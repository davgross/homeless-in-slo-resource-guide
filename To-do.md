# To-do list

1. There may still be some notes in @Directory.md that really belong in @"Resource Guide.md" -- fix that.

1. A lot of @"Resource Guide.md" is still in the form of lists of raw notes; these need to be prosified for the end user.

1. Carefully fact check everything and add source code comments indicating the date of the fact check and the source of the verified information.

1. Consider which open-source license to use for the project.

1. Add anchors to h2/h3 headings in @"Resource Guide.md" that currently lack them, and link to those anchors from the Resource Guide's TOC.

1. Consider ways to make pages, sections, subsections, and directory entries available for printing in a graceful way.

1. Replace "--" dashes, ' and " straight-quotes, and ' apostrophes with better unicode characters. (Claude struggles with such characters, so this may be a task for a human.)

1. Ensure that icon designs have not been inadvertently copied without permission (most are just emojis, I think).

1. Review the site under a variety of color-blindness simulators to see if it's still readable.
