# To-do list

1. There may still be some notes in @Directory.md that really belong in @"Resource Guide.md" -- fix that.

1. A lot of @"Resource Guide.md" is still in the form of lists of raw notes; these need to be prosified for the end user.

1. Carefully fact check everything and add source code comments indicating the date of the fact check and the source of the verified information.

1. Consider which open-source license to use for the project.

1. Consider ways to make individual pages, sections, subsections, and directory entries available for printing in a graceful way.

1. Replace "--" dashes, ' and " straight-quotes, and ' apostrophes with better unicode characters. (Claude struggles with such characters, so this may be a task for a human.)

1. Review the site under a variety of color-blindness simulators to see if it's still readable.

1. For things like Little Free Libraries and Little Free Pantries, rather than just giving a large list of them with their street addresses and map links, it would be nice to have a single, zoomable map that shows the locations of *all* of them, perhaps centered on the user's current location (if that location is within the region contaning them).

1. Create a song-and-dance presentation to show the app off to service providers; make a shareable video out of it. It should highlight 1) why this is superior to other similar projects (e.g. easier to keep updated, easier to collaborate on, feedback button, FOSS), 2) how to get involved, 3) scope (SLO County), ...

1. Figure out how to make sure DNS / hosting / GitHub credentials can get handed off gracefully in case D.G. is incapacitated.

1. Consider the option of having the {font size} / {install app} / {share app} / {feedback} buttons on the right, and on the left have the {toc} icon at the top, stacked above a vertical series of icons that are links to the major sections of the Resource guide (the same icons that are in the TOC). It would also be helpful to add those icons as prefixes to the h2 section headings for those sections. A complication of this is that screens are unlikely to be tall enough to display all 35 icons vertically, so we would have to come up with a strategy for this. Perhaps:
   - Just truncate the list
   - Make the list of icons vertically-scrollable
   - Choose a smaller number by combining thematically-similar pages, e.g.
      - Shelter & Housing + Property Storage
      - Food + Water Refill
      - Clothing + Laundry
      - Health & Medical Care + Drug Use & Recovery + Tattoo Removal + End-of-Life Help
      - Legal Help + IDs & Documents
      - Banking & Money + Tax Prep
      - Emergency Financial Help + Social Security & Benefits
      - Obtaining Employment + Education & Job Training
      - Phones & Phone Service + Internet & Email + Device Charging
   Another possible complication is if the emojis are not of consistent sizes on all devices, such that they would not make consistently-sized icon buttons.
