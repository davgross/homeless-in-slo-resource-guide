# To-do list

1. There may still be some notes in @Directory.md that really belong in @"Resource Guide.md" -- fix that.

1. A lot of @"Resource Guide.md" is still in the form of lists of raw notes; these need to be prosified for the end user.

1. Carefully fact check everything and add source code comments indicating the date of the fact check and the source of the verified information.

1. Consider which open-source license to use for the project.

1. Add anchors to h2/h3 headings in @"Resource Guide.md" that currently lack them, and link to those anchors from the Resource Guide's TOC.

1. Consider ways to make pages, sections, subsections, and directory entries available for printing in a graceful way.

1. Replace "--" dashes, ' and " straight-quotes, and ' apostrophes with better unicode characters. (Claude struggles with such characters, so this may be a task for a human.)

1. Ensure that icon designs have not been inadvertently copied without permission (most are just emojis, I think).

1. Review the site under a variety of color-blindness simulators to see if it's still readable.

1. For things like Little Free Libraries and Little Free Pantries, rather than just giving a large list of them with their street addresses and map links, it would be nice to have a single, zoomable map that shows the locations of *all* of them, perhaps centered on the user's current location (if that location is within the region contaning them).

1. Come up with a site spell-check tool that is markdown-aware, and that can whitelist things like "SLO" or "Obispo" that are valid in our context but unlikely to be in a global English valid word database.
