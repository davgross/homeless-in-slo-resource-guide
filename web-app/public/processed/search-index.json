something for you but you don't hear back in a reasonable time, check back with them.\nknow your rights\nmany service providers have non-discrimination policies and try to treat people with respect, though policies vary between agencies.\nsome services have specific rules about who can use them (like veterans-only programs, or programs with income limits).\nprivacy policies vary by agency.\ngovernment homeless service providers (and service providers that get government grants and contracts) often share information about their clients through the hmis (homeless management information system).\nbefore such a service provider enters information about you into the hmis, you will receive a privacy notice (español) and will be asked for your consent.\nyou can ask to review this privacy notice at any time. \nthis privacy notice states: \"you are still eligible for services if you refuse to have your standard information shared in hmis.\" \nask about hmis consent for

such a living situation in the future (even as long as a year or more from now), you should try to start this process now. \ndiscuss this with your case manager if you have one, or with the long-term

shaded wet creek beds to dry sunny hillsides. \nit is a shrub or vine and sometimes also climbs trees and so can appear to be tree branches. \nits leaves appear in groups of three, but they can have a variety of shapes and colors (dark to pale green, pale orange, bright red). \nthe plants sometimes also display clusters of tiny green, pale, or brown fruits. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthe plant exudes an oil that causes a skin rash in people who touch it. \nyou do not have to touch the plant to be affected: you just need to touch the oil, which can rub off onto clothing, pet fur, or other items and may remain poisonous for years. \nif you have been near a fire in which poison oak plants were burned, you may be exposed to the oil through the smoke. \nyou can prevent the rash by washing your skin thoroughly as soon as possible after exposure and by washing any clothing or other items that may be carrying the oil. \nrubbing alcohol or detergent soaps can be helpful in removing oils. \nthe rash typically appears 12-48 hours, or even several days after exposure. \nit is typically very itchy, and sometimes blisters.\nyou can treat the rash with over-the-counter steroid (such as hydrocortisone) creams, calamine lotion, or antihistamines. \nif you have trouble breathing or swallowing, you may have inhaled some oils (for example from smoke) and you may be experiencing severe respiratory irritation. \nin such a case you should seek medical attention.\nsunburn\nsunburn is painful. \nit also can make you fatigued and more susceptible to infection. \nin the long run it can put you at higher risk of developing skin cancer. \nhomeless people are more prone to sunburn because they have fewer options to escape the mid-day sun.\nyou can reduce your risk of sunburn by finding shady places to rest during the day, by wearing more thoroughly-covering clothing like long-sleeved shirts and broad-brimmed hats, and by applying sunscreen. \nask homeless service providers if they have any sunscreen they can give you. sometimes they do.\n\nsee the clothing section of this guide for some tips on where to find free or low-cost clothing.\n\nif you develop a sunburn, you can get some relief with over-the-counter salves and creams, or just by keeping the area moist (perhaps with a dampened cloth). \nif you have blisters that break, keep the area clean and covered with a bandage. \nif you notice increasing redness that spreads beyond the area of the burn, or pus, or if you develop a fever, seek medical care as this may indicate an infection. \n\n\n\n",

security card, a birth certificate, and so forth.\nif you have lost such documents, or have never obtained them, this can be an obstacle to working with those agencies and programs.\nthis section of the guide shows you how to obtain or replace documents like these.\nin this section:\n\nsocial security numbers or cards\nid cards and driver's licenses\nbirth, death, and marriage certificates\ncivil case documents\npassports\ntips\n\nsocial security numbers or cards\nyou do not often need your social security card, but you do often need your social security number.\nthe social security administration can help you get a new social security card.\nif you have an account or can create an on-line account at ssa.gov/myaccount, you can request a social security card on-line and it will be mailed to you.\nyou can get help with this process by calling 800-772-1213 (tty: 800-325-0778).\n\nsee mail drops, post office boxes, etc. for ways to get mail if you do not have a stable mailing address.\n\nif you are unable to complete this on-line process, you can visit the local social security administration office to get a new card.\nit will go more smoothly if you can bring some alternative form of identification like a driver's license or passport.\nin the absence of those, a military id, employee id, school id, or health insurance card might be helpful.\nid cards and driver's licenses\na state-issued \"real id,\" or a california driver's license which is also a real id, is a useful form of government-issued photo identification card that is widely accepted by a variety of programs, businesses, and service providers.\nyou get such an identification card from the california dmv.\nyou must visit the california dmv office to have your photo taken and to submit your paperwork.\nyou typically first need to already have another identification document (such as a certified birth certificate, a passport, a permanent resident card, a certificate of naturalization or citizenship, or a permanent resident card) as well as documents that demonstrate your california residency (such as a utility bill, tax return, bank statement, or rental agreement that contains your name and address).\nthere are also fees you typically must pay to obtain either a real id or a driver's license that operates as a real id.\nhowever, if you are homeless, you may be able to get a waiver for fees (a \"no-fee id card\"), and you may be able to use the address of a homeless shelter or other homeless services agency as your california residency address.\nthis is true even if you are only temporarily homeless because you are fleeing domestic violence or a similar dangerous situation.\nyou can only get a simple real id (\"california identification card\") with the no-fee method, not a driver's license.\nhomeless services providers like 40 prado homeless services center, the 5cities homeless coalition (5chc), or the el camino homeless organization (echo) can help you with this process.\nif you have previously received a real id or california driver's license, but you have lost the card and need to replace it, you can begin this process by visiting www.edl.dmv.ca.gov/apply or the california dmv office.\nbirth, death, and marriage certificates\nif you were born in slo county, you can obtain a copy of your birth certificate from the slo county clerk-recorder.\nyou will need to show valid identification (typically, a government-issued photo id like a driver's license or passport).\nthere is also a $32 fee.\nhowever, if you are homeless, you can request an \"affidavit of homeless status for fee exempt certified copy of birth certificate.\"\nyou need to sign this and you also need to get a signature from a \"homeless services provider.\"\nthis exempts you from having to pay the $32 fee.\nhomeless services providers like 40 prado homeless services center, the 5cities homeless coalition (5chc), or the el camino homeless organization (echo) can help you with this process.\nyou can obtain a \"certified copy\" of a birth certificate for yourself or your child or other close relative.\na certified copy allows you to establish your identity.\notherwise you can obtain an \"informational\" copy, which is not valid for establishing identity.\nyou should understand ahead of time whether or not you need a certified copy, and, if so, you should be sure to ask for one specifically when you order your copy.\nyou can also use the vitalchek website to order an informational copy of your birth certificate on-line without visiting the slo county clerk-recorder office.\n(you may need to provide a notarized, sworn statement if you want to order a \"certified copy\" this way, in which case it is probably just as easy to visit the slo county clerk-recorder office.)\nthat may cost a bit more.\ndeath records for deaths that occurred in slo county can also be obtained from the slo county clerk-recorder ($24) or from vitalchek.\nagain, there is a difference between \"certified\" and \"informational\" copies of death certificates, and you should check which one you need before you order it.\nyou can typically only get a \"certified\" copy for a close relative, and you may have to provide additional documentation.\nyou can also get a copy of a marriage certificate that was issued in slo county from the slo county clerk-recorder office ($17) or from vitalchek.\nagain, there is a difference between \"certified\" and \"informational\" copies, and you should check which one you need before you order it.\nyou can typically only get a \"certified\" copy for yourself or a close relative, and you may have to provide additional documentation.\nthere is no homeless fee exemption program for death and marriage certificates the way there is for birth certificates.\nif you need a birth, death, or marriage certificate from another county in california, try the california department of public health's \"vital records\" web page.\nif you need such records from elsewhere in the u.s. outside california, visit the national center for health statistics web page.\nthe vitalchek website can often also get you these records from other areas.\ncivil case documents\nto get copies of slo superior court documents in civil cases to which you are a party, first go to the court offices in san luis obispo or in paso robles.\nthose offices have a publicly-accessible computer at which you can find your case number.\ncourt staff can help you with this process.\nthen review the documents associated with that case, choose which documents you want, and request them.\nyou must pay 50¢ per page to get printouts of these documents.\nif you cannot go to the court offices, you can follow the procedure described on this web page to order documents by mail.\nif you have a lawyer, that lawyer may be able to search for these documents on-line themselves.\n\nsee the legal help & crime victim protection section for some tips on getting help from a lawyer.\n\npassports\na u.s. passport is required for international travel to most countries outside the united states.\nyou need a passport to travel by air, land, or sea to most international destinations.\ngetting a passport for the first time\nto apply for your first u.s. passport, you must apply in person at an authorized passport acceptance facility.\nyou cannot apply by mail for a first-time passport.\nit costs $165 total ($130 application fee + $35 execution fee) to apply for an adult passport.\nyou must bring the following documents:\n\nproof of u.s. citizenship (certified u.s. birth certificate with official seal, or certificate of naturalization, or certificate of citizenship, or consular report of birth abroad, or a previous u.s. passport)\nnote: digital or mobile birth certificates are not accepted; you must bring a physical birth certificate\n\n\na photo identification with your picture (driver's license, government employee id, u.s. military id, or certificate of naturalization or citizenship)\nnote: digital or photocopied documents are not accepted; you must bring the original document\nyou must also submit photocopies of the front and back of your id\n\n\na recent passport photo that meets official requirements\na completed form ds-11 (do not it sign until you are instructed to do so by the passport agent)\n\nyou also must provide an address where you can receive your passport by mail.\nif you do not have a stable address, consider using a mail drop service (see the mail drops section of this guide).\nyou can apply for a passport at the post office.\ncall them to make an appointment:\n\n\n\ncity\npost office address\nphone\n\n\n\natascadero\n9800 el camino

five years ago and you need a new one, or if your passport was lost or damaged and you need a new one, you can also apply for a passport at certain slo county public libraries branches. \ncall them to make an appointment:\n\natascadero library\nnipomo library\nslo city library\n\nrenewing your passport\nyou can renew your passport by mail if all of the following are true:\n\nyou have your most recent passport with you\nyour passport is not damaged or mutilated\nyour passport was issued when you were age 16 or older\nyour passport was issued in the last 15 years\nyour passport is in your current name (or you can document a legal name change)\n\nif you meet these requirements, you can renew by mail using form ds-82.\nthis costs $130 for adults.\nyou can also renew online at travel.state.gov if you meet additional eligibility requirements.\nif you cannot renew by mail (for example, if your passport is lost, stolen, damaged, or expired more than five years), you must apply in person using the same process as for a first-time passport.\nreplacing a lost or stolen passport\nif your passport is lost or stolen, follow these steps to get a new one:\n\nreport it immediately:\n  report your passport lost or stolen as soon as possible.\n  this protects you from identity theft.\n  you can report online using form ds-64, by calling 877-487-2778 (tty 888-874-7793), or in person when you apply for a replacement.\n  note that if you report your passport lost or stolen, you can no longer use it for travel even if you find it later.\n\napply for a replacement:\n  to replace a lost or stolen passport, apply in person at an authorized passport acceptance facility.\n  the process and requirements are the same as for a first-time passport application (see above).\n  reporting your passport lost or stolen does not replace it; to get a replacement you must also apply for a new passport.\n  this costs $165.\n\n\npassports from other countries\nif you are a citizen of another country and you need to obtain or renew a passport from your home country, contact your country's embassy or consulate.\nthe nearest consulates for many countries are located in los angeles or san francisco.\nyou can find contact information for embassies and consulates at embassy.goabroad.com or by searching online for your country's embassy or consulate in the united states.\ntips\ndocument storage and security\nhere are some tips for handling important documents:\n\nuse your phone camera to take photos of important documents, and save those photos \"in the cloud\" (icloud for iphone, google photos for android) so still have access to your photos if your phone is lost or stolen.\nmake copies of important documents, and store the copies separately from the originals.\nthat way if you lose one set, you are less likely to lose all of them.\nsome homeless services centers offer document storage for their clients.\nask your case worker if they can store your important documents in your file at those agencies.\nif you have enough money, consider storing especially important or difficult-to-replace documents in a safety deposit box at a bank.\nthese can be rented for $30-50 per year.\n\nif you have no identification documents\nif you are completely without identifying documentation, you may need help establishing your identity so that you can access programs and services that require identifying documentation.\nyou may want to begin by contacting the social security administration who can assist you in verifying your identity through their records.\nslo court self-help services can help you through california's affidavit processes, with which you can establish your identity when you lack identity documentation.\nthis way you can get a california photo id card, which helps you get access to many programs and services.\nthere is an expensive filing fee for this process, but ask about a fee waiver that is available to people with low incomes.\nif you have a case manager, ask them if they can help you with this process.\n\n",
