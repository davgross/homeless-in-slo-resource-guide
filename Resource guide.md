# Avoiding, Surviving, and Escaping Homelessness in SLO

This guide helps you find free and low-cost resources that can help you if you are experiencing homelessness, are threatened with homelessness, or are just short on money.
It is specific to San Luis Obispo County.

The guide is organized into pages by topics like “Shelter and housing” or “Food”.
Each page briefly describes resources available in San Luis Obispo County.
Many of these resources contain boldface links to our [**Directory**](Directory.md).
This Directory page lists resources in alphabetical order, along with information like the website, phone number, email address, location, and operating hours of the resource.
If you find a resource in the guide that seems it will be useful to you, click the boldface link to go to the directory and find out how to access that resource.

San Luis Obispo County is an especially challenging place for people trying to avoid or to escape homelessness.
Nearly one in four homeless people in the United States lives in California.
California has one of the highest per-capita rates of homelessness in the nation, and the highest percentage of unsheltered homeless people.
(In San Luis Obispo County, there are only enough shelter beds for about 20–30% of the people known to be homeless here, and so the county has the third highest percentage of unsheltered homelessness in the U.S.)
The city of San Luis Obispo is one of top ten most expensive cities in the U.S. based on how much income (relative to the median income) you must have in order to afford to buy a home.
10% of schoolchildren in SLO County are homeless.

Why are things especially difficult here?
There are many reasons, but the most important ones can be summed up by “too few homes for the number of people who need them.”
The reasons why that is a problem are complicated, but include government policies that discourage homebuilding and make it more expensive, and resource constraints.

Fortunately, there is a lot of help available to people experiencing or threatened with homelessness in SLO County.
Unfortunately, it can be difficult to discover this help or to understand how to access it.
We hope this guide will make it easier.

This guide was developed by volunteers from [**Shower the People**](Directory.md#Shower-the-People).

## <a id="tips-on-self-advocacy-and-for-communicating-with-service-providers">Tips on Self-Advocacy and for Communicating with Service Providers</a>

### Build Good Relationships with Case Managers and Service Providers

When you meet with case managers and service providers, you can get better results by being prepared.
Bring your ID, any paperwork about your situation, and a list of questions or needs.
Arrive early if you can.
If you will be late, call ahead.
Keep a simple notebook or use your phone to write down appointments, contacts, and any promises people make to you.

Be honest and direct when you explain your situation, your needs, and any problems you face.
Ask questions if you need help understanding programs, requirements, or next steps.
When providers help you, tell them you appreciate it.
Good relationships help everyone.
If someone promises to do something for you but you don't hear back in a reasonable time, check back with them.

### Know Your Rights

Many service providers have non-discrimination policies and try to treat people with respect, though policies vary between agencies.
Some services have specific rules about who can use them (like veterans-only programs, or programs with income limits).

Privacy policies vary by agency.
Government agencies often share information through HMIS (Homeless Management Information System).
You will receive privacy notices before they enter your data, and you can ask to review these notices later.
Some data may be required to get services, but you can withhold other information.
Ask about Release of Information (ROI) forms and what they mean before you sign them.

Many programs have procedures for appealing decisions or filing complaints.
Ask program staff or search online to find the specific process.
Legal aid organizations can help with appeals (see the [Legal assistance](#legal-help--mediation-crime-victim-protection) section).

### Document Everything

Keep copies of important documents and applications.
Store documents in waterproof bags.
Use your backpack as a pillow when you sleep.
Keep your most important items in clothes pockets.
If you have income, consider getting a safety deposit box.

Use your phone to take photos of important paperwork.
Turn on automatic cloud backup (iCloud for iPhone, Google Photos for Android) so your photos survive if your phone is lost or stolen.
Phones (iPhones & Androids) typically come with some amount of free cloud storage, so you can keep access to your photos even if you lose your phone.

Write down the dates, names, and outcomes of important conversations.
Keep case numbers, application numbers, and confirmation numbers.

### Focus on Your Goals and Strengths

Tell people clearly what you are working toward (housing, employment, healthcare, etc.).
Share your skills, experience, education, and personal strengths when they matter for the services you want.
For example, tell employment services about your work experience, but you don't need to tell basic needs programs (like clothing or food) about these things.

Come to meetings with ideas about what might work for your situation.
Follow through on promises you make and take active steps toward your goals.

### Navigate System Barriers

Learn the rules for programs: who can use them, when applications are due, and what steps you need to take.
If you don't qualify for one program, ask about other options.
If you have disabilities or special needs, ask about help they can provide.

If you're not getting help, ask to speak with supervisors.
Use formal complaint procedures and appeal processes.
Or find someone who knows the system well to help you (like a case manager, behavioral health navigator, legal aid worker, or peer advocate).

### Work with Multiple Service Providers

Let each provider know about other services you get when it matters.
For example, tell housing programs about your income sources.
But casual services like showers don't need to know about each other.

If an agency plans to apply for a service in your name, tell them if you already applied on your own.
This prevents duplicate applications.
Keep track of which applications you made or that others made for you.
This helps you avoid wasting time doing the same thing twice.

Share information that relates directly to the services you want.
For example, share your income for benefits applications or your medical history for healthcare.
Keep other personal details private.

Keep a list of contact information for all your service providers.
Ask for direct phone numbers or business cards from people who know your case.
This helps you avoid phone trees.

### Set Goals and Track Progress

Make your goals “S.M.A.R.T.” (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound).
Divide big goals (like getting housing) into smaller steps you can manage.
Notice and celebrate your achievements, even small ones.
Be flexible and willing to change your goals as your situation changes.

### When Things Go Wrong

Even when you feel frustrated, stay calm and speak respectfully.
This approach usually gets better results and faster solutions than arguing, though this may feel strange if you learned to be assertive to protect yourself.
Write down details about problems, including dates, names, and what went wrong.
Don't give up too soon.
Sticking with it often pays off when you work with complex systems.

### Find and Use Resources

Use this guide or call [211](tel:+1-211) to get information about available services.
Talk with other people in similar situations—they often have valuable information and tips.

Remember that this guide shows information that was available when we published it.
Things may change.
Contact service providers directly to check current information before you travel to their locations.

Stay in touch with providers who are especially helpful, even when you're not actively using their services.

### Manage Appointments and Commitments

Set phone alarms or ask for reminder calls when they are available.
Make sure you have a way to get to appointments (see the [Transportation](#transportation) section).
Bring something to do and expect some delays in busy service settings.
If you need to change an appointment, call ahead rather than simply not showing up.

## <a id="where-to-find-shelter--housing">Shelter and Housing</a>

### <a id="eviction-protection">Eviction Prevention</a>

If you are about to be evicted because you are unable to pay rent, or if you’ve had to move your family into a hotel, you can get immediate financial help from the [**CalWORKS Homeless Assistance Program**](Directory.md#CalWORKS) or the [**Housing Support Program (HSP)**](Directory.md#Housing-Support-Program).
For either of these options, you must first get a referral from the [**SLO County Department of Social Services**](Directory.md#SLO-County-Department-of-Social-Services).

[**5Cities Homeless Coalition (5CHC)**](Directory.md#5CHC) operates a [housing assistance program](https://5chc.org/programs/housing-assistance) that offers financial assistance for rent for people in danger of becoming homeless.
Contact 5CHC to arrange a confidential coordinated entry interview.

> See the [Legal Help, Mediation, and Crime Victim Protection](#legal-help--mediation-crime-victim-protection) section for options about preventing illegal evictions.

> See the [Acute Financial Needs](#acute-financial-needs) section for more possible ways to get short-term financial help in a crisis.

### <a id="overnight-shelter">Overnight Shelter</a>

If you are unsheltered and need a place to sleep tonight, these are some options:

The [**40 Prado Homeless Services Center**](Directory.md#40-Prado) has a hundred overnight shelter beds.
Many are reserved for people who have previously registered with 40 Prado, but a limited number are available on a walk-in basis.
To get a bed, first come on-site and complete the intake process any day from 8am to 2pm.
Thereafter, on any day when you need an overnight shelter bed, check in from 4:30pm to 6pm to secure a bed or to be placed on the waiting list.
They also offer meals (breakfast, lunch, and dinner), showers, laundry, mail/phone services, an integrated medical clinic (primary and urgent care five days a week with an on-site pharmacy), recuperative care beds, and an animal kennel.
To use the shelter, you must be a county resident with ID, you must not be a P.C. 290 registered sex offender, and you must participate in case management.

The 40 Prado center is the only walk-in, overnight homeless shelter in SLO County.
The [**El Camino Homeless Organization (ECHO)**](Directory.md#ECHO) used to operate a shelter in the north county, but now only offers 90-day transitional housing there ([see below](#transitional-and-long-term-housing)).

There is a shelter in Santa Maria, the [**Good Samaritan Shelter**](Directory.md#Good-Samaritan-Shelter).
They offer 90-day emergency homeless shelter to people from the Santa Maria Valley area.
They also have laundry facilities, hot meals, substance use treatment, and mental health services.
Contact them between 8:30am and 5pm to set up an intake appointment.

If you are homeless because you are escaping dangerous circumstances of domestic violence or sexual assault, you can get safe, confidential, emergency shelter at safe houses operated by [**Lumina Alliance**](Directory.md#Lumina-Alliance).
They will also help you with trained advocacy, accompaniment to medical/legal appointments, case management, and therapy for survivors and children.
They operate throughout SLO County, and are open to people of all genders, ages, and backgrounds.

If you are homeless and have a medically verified need for 24/7 temporary housing because you are seriously ill, recovering from surgery or injury or high-risk pregnancy, or something of that nature, you may qualify for the [**Medically Fragile Homeless Program**](Directory.md#Medically-Fragile-Homeless-Program).
They will help you with immediate housing, supportive services and coordinated case management to ensure physical recovery, access to income sources, connection to services, and a more permanent housing alternative when you exit the program.
You cannot apply for this program yourself, but you must get a referral from an agency like [**Adult Protective Services**](Directory.md#Adult-Protective-Services), [**SLO County Department of Social Services**](Directory.md#SLO-County-Department-of-Social-Services), [**Housing Support Program (HSP)**](Directory.md#Housing-Support-Program), [**Center for Family Strengthening (CSF)**](Directory.md#CSF), or [**CalWORKS**](Directory.md#CalWORKS).
If you are being treated by a hospital or other medical professionals, consider telling them that you are homeless and asking them if they can help you with this process.

### <a id="transitional-and-long-term-housing">Transitional and Long-Term Housing</a>

This section discusses more long-term housing options including *transitional housing* (a temporary home while you search for more long-term housing) and *affordable housing* or *subsidized housing* (a long-term home).

The [**Coordinated Entry System (CES)**](Directory.md#CES) is SLO county’s system for matching people in need with transitional or long-term housing that is appropriate for them.
If you want to get such housing, you should try to enter this system.
This can be more effective than trying to contact the many individual transitional or long-term housing programs one at a time.
To enter this system, contact one of the many participating agencies, such as [**SLO County Department of Social Services**](Directory.md#SLO-County-Department-of-Social-Services), [**5Cities Homeless Coalition**](Directory.md#5CHC), [**Community Action Partnership San Luis Obispo (CAPSLO)**](Directory.md#CAPSLO), [**Transitions Mental Health Association**](Directory.md#TMHA), [**Good Samaritan Shelter**](Directory.md#Good-Samaritan-Shelter), or [**SLO County Health Department**](Directory.md#SLO-County-Health-Department).

A program called [**Housing Now**](Directory.md#Housing-Now) finds homes for the most vulnerable chronically homeless people from SLO County.
You cannot apply directly to participate in this program, but if you enter the Coordinated Entry System (see above), that system may eventually place you in this program so that you can quickly get a home.

The [**Behavioral Health Bridge Housing (BHBH)**](Directory.md#BHBH) has some quality, affordable short-term (less than 90 days) and medium term (90 days to two years) housing for people in SLO county who have severe behavioral health issues who are homeless or at risk of homelessness.
For information on the application process, how to demonstrate eligibility, and bed availability call Mark Lamore, Director of Homeless Services at [**Transitions Mental Health Association (TMHA)**](Directory.md#TMHA), at [805-540-6500](tel:+1-805-540-6500).

[**5Cities Homeless Coalition (5CHC)**](Directory.md#5CHC) operates a [housing assistance program](https://5chc.org/programs/housing-assistance) that offers case management and financial assistance for rent, deposit, and immediate needs, and housing assistance through various funding grants.
This is available both to currently homeless people and to people in danger of becoming homeless.
Contact 5CHC to arrange a confidential coordinated entry interview.

[**El Camino Homeless Organization (ECHO)**](Directory.md#ECHO) operates transitional (90-day) shelters in Atascadero and Paso Robles that serve people experiencing homelessness.
People who live in these shelters also get individualized case management services to help them find employment and long-term housing.
There is often a long waiting list for shelter beds.
They will not admit P.C. 290 registered sex offenders.

The [**CalWORKS Homeless Assistance Program**](Directory.md#CalWORKS) can pay a one-time security deposit and/or last month’s rent and/or utility deposit for families who are homeless or who have received a “Pay Rent or Quit” notice on their current rental home.
To qualify you must meet CalWORKs eligibility requirements and have less than $100 in liquid assets.

[**Family Care Network**](Directory.md#Family-Care-Network)’s [**Housing Support Program (HSP)**](Directory.md#Housing-Support-Program) provides financial assistance for housing deposits and rent to families that are experiencing homelessness or are at risk of homelessness in SLO County.
They also offer case management and life skills workshops (budgeting, credit repair, communication), bus passes, gas cards, and paperwork assistance.

[**Balay Ko on Barka**](Directory.md#Balay-Ko-on-Barka) (a.k.a. “My Home for Hope”) and [**Cabins for Change**](Directory.md#Cabins-for-Change), both in Grover Beach, operate many individual “tiny homes” that serve as transitional (90–180 days) housing.
The cabins come with 24/7 support, case management, connections to food services and recovery, and house stabilization guidance.
They have on-site laundry and showers.
They accept pets.
They typically have a long waiting list.
Apply through [**5Cities Homeless Coalition**](Directory.md#5CHC) to get on the waiting list.

[**Housing Authority of SLO (HASLO)**](Directory.md#HASLO) operates several affordable housing properties in SLO county.
Typically in these projects, residents pay a portion of the rent, while the rest of the rent is paid for them by subsidies or vouchers.
To qualify to rent one of these housing units, you must have enough income to pay your portion of the rent, but you must not have so much income that you could afford non-subsidized housing.
Typically this means households that earn less than 30% of the area median income.
Preference is given to SLO County residents and to veterans. Some housing is restricted to seniors (age 62 and above).
You need to provide proof of income and your prior rental history.
Most of these housing units have wait lists, and only some of them accept new applications at any time.

[**Paso Robles Housing Authority**](Directory.md#Paso-Robles-Housing-Authority) operates several affordable housing properties in Paso Robles designed for people who have around 30–60% of the area median income.
You can fill out an application on their website. If your application is accepted, you will be put on the waiting list.
You must include copies of the latest three months’ paycheck stubs, proof of other sources of income, and a copy of your last two years’ federal income tax returns.
You may be rejected if you have recently been evicted, have defaulted on debts, or have certain criminal convictions.

[**Lumina Alliance**](Directory.md#Lumina-Alliance) operates a six- to 24-month [transitional housing program](https://luminaalliance.org/transitional-housing/) for individuals and families who are fleeing domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and/or stalking.
People housed through this program also get access to advocacy services, employment assistance, counseling, legal help, children’s services, life skills development, and help obtaining permanent housing.
If you are homeless or in need of housing due to fleeing abusive situation, have low or very low income, and are willing to participate in Lumina’s program and to cooperate with them in following a safety plan, you may qualify for transitional housing through this program.

Adults in SLO County who live with mental illness may qualify for supportive housing in multiple county locations through the [**Transitions Mental Health Association (TMHA)**](Directory.md#TMHA) [residential housing program](https://www.t-mha.org/program-details.php?id=6).

The [**HomeShare SLO**](Directory.md#HomeShare-SLO) program matches property owners who have an extra room with people who need a place to live.
They have a “reduced rent task exchange” program with which you can do 8–15 hours of work per week to get a rent reduction.

[**Restorative Partners**](Directory.md#Restorative-Partners) runs a [housing program](https://restorativepartners.org/housing/) with multiple transitional housing programs for men, women, and families in various SLO County locations.
These programs are for people in recovery from addiction and people transitioning from incarceration.
Some are specific to women with children.
Along with housing, residents get help with employment support, financial literacy, life skills, addiction recovery, and help finding permanent housing.
There is a wait list.

[**Salvation Army**](Directory.md#Salvation-Army) has a “Rapid Rehousing Program” that helps people find and qualify for long-term housing.

The [**HouseKeys**](Directory.md#HouseKeys) program is the city of SLO’s affordable home-ownership program.
It serves households who bring in about 30–50% of the area median income.
Their idea of “affordable” may not be yours.
If you want to apply for housing through this program, begin the [application process](https://www.housekeys.org/applicationprocess) described on their website.

[**Habitat for Humanity SLO County**](Directory.md#Habitat-for-Humanity) operates a home ownership program for first-time low-income home buyers and home preservation assistance (minor repairs, landscaping, painting) for low-income homeowners.
Apply via their website.

[**Peoples’ Self-Help Housing**](Directory.md#Peoples-Self-Help-Housing) operates a “sweat equity” homeownership program in which families help to build their own homes.
They also operate affordable rental housing developments and supportive housing programs.
They serve low-income families, farmworkers, seniors, veterans, people with disabilities, and formerly-homeless people.
Contact them directly to access the program.

Some other potential low-income options include:

- [Roosevelt Family Apartmments](https://www.rooseveltfamilyapts.com/) in Nipomo.

## <a id="property-storage-options">Property Storage Options</a>

### <a id="short-term-property-storage">Short-Term</a>

If you need to securely store a small amount of property for a few hours or overnight, you have a few options:

The [**40 Prado Homeless Services Center**](Directory.md#40-Prado) has storage lockers available for people who have completed intake for day services there.
You must provide your own padlock.
<!-- Note: Unable to determine specific locker sizes, conditions of use, or whether document storage is available from publicly available sources (as of October 2025); contact 40 Prado directly at [805-544-4004](tel:+1-805-544-4004) for details -->

The commercial service [Bounce](https://bounce.com/) partners with multiple locations (in SLO County, these are typically UPS Stores) to offer short-term luggage storage that typically runs about $7 per day or $20–80 per month (depending on weight and size).
You can find the specific locations, terms and conditions, and costs at their website.

In a few locations in SLO County (Morro St. in SLO, at Cal Poly, and at the Curbaril Park-n-Ride in Atascadero) you can find [on-demand bike lockers](https://rideshare.org/bike-lockers/).
These cost 5¢ per hour and can be rented for up to seven consecutive days.
Use the [BikeLink](https://www.bikelink.org/) app to access and pay for these lockers.
They are for bicycles only (you cannot use them to store other personal belongings like carts or suitcases), but you can probably get away with storing pannier bags along with your bicycle.

### <a id="long-term-property-storage">Long-Term</a>

There are several commercial long-term storage options in SLO County.
You can find these by doing a web search for terms like “self storage” or “mini storage”.
They typically rent spaces by the month, and have different-sized units available at different prices.
5′×5′, 5′×10′, and 10′×10′ units are typical.
You can expect to pay about $60–75 per month for the least-expensive and smallest sizes, up to $150 for larger sizes.
Most storage facilities have daytime hours of operation when you can access the storage units to add or remove property, and are closed to everyone at night.

### <a id="little-free-pantries">Little Free Pantries</a>

Little free pantries are small boxes erected in neighborhoods and maintained by the people who live nearby.
They are self-serve and open 24/7.
They are stocked by people who have extra things to give away.
You never know quite what you will find there, but there is usually some canned and packaged non-perishable food, and sometimes toiletries and other small essentials.

Sometimes people put perishible food in little free pantries, but you should beware of eating such food as it may have been there for a while and may no longer be safe to eat.

See [**Little Free Pantries**](Directory.md#Little-Free-Pantries) in the [Directory](Directory.md) for a list of locations.

### <a id="food-box-distributions">Food Box Distributions</a>

The [**SLO Food Bank**](Directory.md#SLO-Food-Bank) gives away food boxes on a regular schedule at a variety of locations in SLO County.
Visit [slofoodbank.org/food-locator](https://www.slofoodbank.org/food-locator/) for a complete list and schedule of these “Neighborhood Food Distributions.”

### <a id="summer-meal-sites">Summer Meal Sites (for Children)</a>

The California Department of Education has a “Summer Food Service Program” to help children during the Summer school break who usually get meals at school.
This program is open to all children in the community.
You can find a list of [Summer Meal Sites in San Luis Obispo County](https://www.cde.ca.gov/ds/sh/sn/ap/summersites.asp?year=2025&countyname=San_Luis_Obispo) at the California Department of Education website.

### <a id="senior-meal-programs">Senior Meal Programs</a>

[**Meals that Connect**](Directory.md#Meals-that-Connect) has several sites in SLO County where they serve communal lunches every weekday.
The program is for people aged 60 and above.
You must fill out an application to join the program, and you must reserve your meals two days in advance.
They also can deliver meals to your home if you are homebound.

[**Five Cities Meals on Wheels**](Directory.md#5Cities-Meals-on-Wheels) is a similar program specific to the Five Cities area that provides daily meals, delivered to the homes of people who cannot prepare nutritious meals for themselves and do not have caretakers who can do so.
They serve homebound neighbors in Arroyo Grande, Grover Beach, Oceano, Pismo Beach, and Shell Beach.
They serve seniors and people with temporary or permanent disabilities.

Low-income seniors (aged 60 and above) can get $20–50 in credit to use at participating farmers markets from the California Department of Food and Agriculture.
There is limited availability, so if the program runs out of credits you may have to wait until their next budget to apply.
Learn more about the program and apply to join it at [their website](https://www.cdfa.ca.gov/SeniorFarmersMrktNutritionPrgm/).

### <a id="calfresh-ebt-wic">CalFresh / EBT (Food Stamps) and WIC</a>

The CalFresh program is California’s version of the federal nutrition program known as “SNAP” or “food stamps.”
If you have a low income, California will give you an “EBT card” which you can use like a debit card at grocery stores and farmers markets to buy healthy foods.

You can apply for CalFresh on-line at either of the following sites:

- [BenefitsCal.com](https://benefitscal.com/)
- [GetCalFresh.org](https://www.getcalfresh.org/)

You can also apply in person at the [**SLO County Department of Social Services**](Directory.md#SLO-County-Department-of-Social-Services).

If you are a Cal Poly student, you can get assistance from the [**Cal Poly CalFresh Program**](https://www.calfreshcalpoly.org/).

You will need some identification document, proof of income, and (for students) indication of student status, and (for non-citizens) immigration status.
Suitable proof of income includes pay stubs from last 30 days, an employer letter on company letterhead, tax forms (1040, W-2, 1099), self-employment profit/loss statement or ledger, or a signed written statement if you do not have those documents.
See [calfresh.guide](https://calfresh.guide/verifications-the-calfresh-office-requires/) for more details.

Some local farmers markets will double up to $15 in CalFresh benefits that you spend at the market, so you can get twice as much food for your money.
See [slocountyfarmers.org](https://www.slocountyfarmers.org/snap) for details.

The [**Women, Infants, and Children (WIC)**](Directory.md#WIC) program also provides E-WIC debit cards with which you can buy certain types of food from farmers markets and WIC-approved groceries.

### <a id="edible-wild-plants">Edible Wild Plants</a>

There are many edible wild plants available in SLO County.
When they are in season, they can add nutrition to your diet.

**Warning:** Some wild plants are poisonous.
You should only forage for wild plants if you know what you are doing.
Also: beware of foraging plants in agricultural or well-tended areas, as they may have been treated with pesticides.
Don’t forage plants from waste sites, stagnant water areas, or areas subject to agricultural or industrial run-off, as the plants may take up toxins or parasites from the soil or water.

Some common edible plants in SLO County are:

Sometimes you will also see edible fruit trees like plums or cherries on sidewalks, in parks, or in other public places.

Sometimes also people plant fruit trees on their own property but then neglect to harvest the fruit, perhaps because there is more than they need.
In such a case you can ask the property owner for permission to harvest from their trees.

## <a id="where-to-refill-a-water-bottle">Where to Refill a Water Bottle</a>

Most major parks and recreation facilities have water fountains and/or water bottle refill stations, as do some public libraries.

The city of SLO also has a water bottle filling station network.
Some of these stations are inside buildings and are only accessible when the building is open for business.
Others are outside and are available 24/7.
You can find a map of these hydration stations [at this link](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/ac825840143c4d718e06397d5306fa89) or at [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?mid=1ojOfK6l3mkAh6JIfFJZwA5ej5Qj232No&ll=35.27079109833796%2C-120.65453885&z=15).

[Runabout Paratransit](https://www.slorta.org/services/runabout-paratransit/) is a county-wide transit service for people who cannot always use the fixed-route SLO RTA buses because of disability.
This service will take you door-to-door within ¾-mile of the RTA fixed routes during the same hours RTA operates.
One personal care attendant can accompany you free-of-charge.
You have to apply and have an in-person interview to be eligible for this service (call [805-781-4833](tel:+1-805-781-4833) or visit 253 Elks Lane, SLO, M–Th 8am–4pm, or Fri. by appointment).
After you register, make ride reservations 1–7 days in advance by calling [805-541-2544](tel:+1-805-541-2544).
Rides are not free; they cost about twice as much as ordinary RTA rides.
However people who qualify to use Runabout Paratransit can also ride the ordinary RTA service for free.

[**SLO Transit**](Directory.md#SLO-Transit) is the within-city San Luis Obispo bus system.
You can use the [SLO Transit RiderPortal](https://slo.rider.peaktransit.com/) website or phone app ([iPhone](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/slo-transit/id458554556?mt=8), [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=edu.calpoly.android.SloBusMapper&hl=en)) to view routes and to see when the next bus is due to arrive.
You can buy bus passes on the bus or by using the [Token Transit](https://tokentransit.com/riders/download) app.
(Another option for viewing bus arrival times and for planning travel is the [moovit](https://moovitapp.com/index/en/public_transit-San_Luis_Obispo_CA-4003) app.)
There are discounts for seniors and disabled people (you may need to [apply for a special card](https://forms.slocity.org/Forms/SDPassApp)), and for children.
If you buy a regional day pass from SLO RTA, that also lets you ride SLO Transit buses.

You can find carpool options locally by using the [iRideshare](https://irideshare.org/#/) web application, a free program for SLO County commuters.
The application matches commuters based on their locations, routes, destinations, and schedules to try to match them into compatible carpools.

If you register for iRideshare and you commute to work by walking, biking, taking the bus, or in a carpool or vanpool, and you need to get home from work in some other way (for example, because the carpool is leaving at the wrong time, or because your bike broke down), the [Guaranteed Ride Home](https://rideshare.org/program/guaranteed-ride-home/) program will pay for your taxi, Uber, or Lyft ride home.
(You need to save the receipt, and you can only get a limited number of guaranteed rides home.)

The [**Family Care Network**](Directory.md#Family-Care-Network) can help you get a bus pass if you cannot afford one on your own.
You may first need to get a referral from a [**SLO County Department of Social Services**](Directory.md#SLO-County-Department-of-Social-Services) Employment Resource Specialist.

There are [Dial-A-Ride](https://www.slorta.org/services/dial-a-ride/) services in Atascadero, Morro Bay, Nipomo, Paso Robles, Shandon, and Templeton.
They typically offer curb-to-curb service and charge $2.25–8.00 each way (sometimes less for seniors, disabled people, and children):

### <a id="transportation-for-seniors">Transportation Resources for Seniors</a>

Many transit services have reduced fares for seniors.
People aged 80 and older ride for free on all SLO RTA and SLO Transit routes.
In addition, there are some transit options specificially for seniors.

For example, the [**Senior Go!**](Directory.md#Senior-Go) service serves people aged 65 and up.
It serves all of SLO County, and all trips must be within SLO County.
Call to book a curb-to-curb ride two to three days in advance. You can reserve up to four round-trips per month.
The cost is $5 for short trips (0–20 miles) or $10 for longer trips.

The [CenCal/Medi-Cal Shuttle](https://www.cencalhealth.org/members/transportation/) offers free, door-to-door transportation to medical appointments for people who are enrolled in Medi-Cal and who cannot use public transportation to get to their appointments.
If you expect you will need to stop at a pharmacy after your appointment, say so when you make your shuttle reservation.
Make a shuttle reservation at least three days before your medical appointment by calling [855-659-4600](tel:+1-855-659-4600).

If you are a [**Community Health Centers of the Central Coast (CHC)**](Directory.md#CHC) patient, and you need a ride to your CHC appointment, you can get shuttle service.
The CHC Shuttle picks you up at your location and drops you off at the clinic, then returns you after your appointment.
To use the shuttle, you should have a CHC appointment and live in the area of the CHC clinic.
CHC may also give you an RTA bus pass to help you get to your appointment.
Make a reservation at least 48 hours before your appointment by calling [877-743-3242](tel:+1-877-743-3242).
They will call you back within 24 hours to confirm your reservation.

Veterans who travel to VA health care facilities for VA-authorized appointments can get free curb-to-curb shuttle service through [**Veterans Transportation Service (VTS)**](Directory.md#Veterans-Transportation-Service).

Here are some tips for keeping your bike safe if you are camping:

- Lock bikes together when you camp with multiple people.
- Position your bike near your tent and thread one of the tent’s guy-lines through the wheel, so your tent will shake if someone moves the bike.
- Use multiple locks (for example, a U-lock and a cable). Avoid using cable locks only, as they are relatively easy to break.
- Consider using a lock that makes an audible alarm when it is tampered with.

### <a id="emergency-care">Emergency Care</a>

#### 911

Call 911 immediately when someone needs emergency medical care that cannot wait.
This includes when a person:

- Cannot breathe or struggles severely to breathe
- Has no pulse or appears unconscious and unresponsive
- Bleeds heavily and cannot stop the bleeding
- Shows signs of stroke (sudden face drooping, arm weakness, or speech difficulty)
- Experiences chest pain that might indicate a heart attack
- Has a severe allergic reaction with swelling or breathing problems
- Suffers a serious injury
- Takes a dangerous overdose of a drug or poison
- Has a seizure (especially if it lasts longer than five minutes or if the person has never had a seizure before)
- Has a severe mental health crisis in which they are an immediate danger to themselves or others

Stay calm and speak clearly to the 911 dispatcher.
The dispatcher will guide you through the process, and may ask you for:

- **Your exact location** — Give the full address, including apartment number, floor, or any access instructions. If you’re unsure of the address, describe nearby landmarks or cross streets.
- **The nature of the emergency** — Briefly describe what happened and the person’s current condition.
- **The patient’s condition** — Report whether the person is conscious, breathing, and responsive. Describe visible injuries or symptoms.
- **Your relationship to the patient** — State whether you are family, a friend, or a bystander.
- **Your contact information** — Provide a phone number where responders can reach you.

Do not hang up until the dispatcher tells you to.
The dispatcher may tell you how to provide care while you wait for help to arrive.
If the situation changes while you wait, call 911 again immediately to update them.

Stay with the patient until help arrives, if it is safe for you to do so.
Choose someone to watch for the ambulance and to guide responders to the location.

#### Emergency Rooms

There are four emergency rooms in our area:

1. [**Arroyo Grande Community Hospital**](Directory.md#Arroyo-Grande-Community-Hospital) (Arroyo Grande)
1. [**Adventist Health Sierra Vista**](Directory.md#Adventist-Health-Sierra-Vista) (SLO)
1. [**French Hospital Medical Center**](Directory.md#French-Hospital-Medical-Center) (SLO)
1. [**Adventist Health Twin Cities**](Directory.md#Adventist-Health-Twin-Cities) (Templeton)

These emergency rooms are open all day, every day.

Do not worry if your Medi-Cal paperwork is not yet in order.
Under the “Hospital Presumptive Eligibility” program, in an emergency, hospitals will treat you as though you have Medi-Cal for up to two months while they work with you to figure out your eligibility, if the following conditions hold:

- You are uninsured and not receiving Medicare.
- You have a low monthly income.
- You live in California.
- You have not used the “Hospital Presumptive Eligibility” program more than once in the past 12 months (more than twice for children).

U.S. Citizenship is not required.
All three emergency rooms participate in the “Hospital Presumptive Eligibility” program.

### <a id="urgent-care">Urgent Care Options</a>

Visit an urgent care center when you have a medical problem that needs prompt attention but is not life-threatening.
Urgent care centers treat conditions that are too serious to wait for a doctor’s appointment but that do not require emergency room services.
The wait is usually shorter than emergency rooms, and the cost is typically lower for non-emergency conditions.
Most urgent care centers accept walk-ins, and some also allow appointments.
Bring your insurance card, identification, and a list of medications you take.

### <a id="poison-oak">Poison Oak</a>

<!-- To-do: add some characteristic photographs showing the variety of leaf shapes/colors. These must be licensed (e.g. creative commons) with usage conditions respected -->

Poison oak is a common plant in SLO County and grows everywhere from shaded wet creekbeds to dry sunny hillsides.
It is a shrub or vine and sometimes also climbs trees and so can appear to be tree branches.
Its leaves appear in groups of three, but they can have a variety of shapes and colors (dark to pale green, pale orange, bright red).
The plants sometimes also display clusters of small green, pale, or red berries.

The plant exudes an oil that causes a skin rash in people who touch it.
You do not have to touch the plant to be affected: you just need to touch the oil, which can rub off onto clothing, pet fur, or other items.
If you have been near a fire in which poison oak plants were burned, you may be exposed to the oil through the smoke.
You can prevent the rash by washing your skin thoroughly soon after exposure and by washing any clothing or other items that may be carrying the oil.
Rubbing alcohol or detergent soaps can be helpful in removing oils.

The rash appears several hours or even a few days after exposure.
It is typically very itchy, and sometimes blisters.
You can treat the rash with over-the-counter steroid (such as hydrocortisone) creams, or calamine lotion.

If you have trouble breathing or swallowing, you may have inhaled some oils (for example from smoke) and you may be experiencing internal swelling.
In such a case you should seek medical attention.

### <a id="sunburn">Sunburn</a>

Sunburn is painful.
It also can make you fatigued and more susceptible to infection.
In the long run it can put you at higher risk of developing skin cancer.

Homeless people are more prone to sunburn because they have fewer options to escape the mid-day sun.
You can reduce your risk of sunburn by finding shady places to rest during the day, by wearing more thoroughly-covering clothing like long-sleeved shirts and broad-brimmed hats, and by applying sunscreen.
Ask homeless service providers if they have any sunscreen they can give you. Sometimes they do.

> See the [Clothing](#where-to-find-free-or-thrift-store-clothing) section of this guide for some tips on where to find free or low-cost clothing.

If you develop a sunburn, you can get some relief with over-the-counter salves and creams, or just by keeping the area moist (perhaps with a dampened cloth).
If you have blisters that break, keep the area clean and covered with a bandage.
If you notice increasing redness that spreads beyond the area of the burn, or pus, or if you develop a fever, seek medical care as this may indicate an infection.

## <a id="tattoo-removal">Tattoo Removal</a>

There are programs available that will erase your tattoos.
This can help you if you have tattoos that interfere with your ability to get a job or that are suggestive of gang or hate group affiliation.
Tattoo removal can help you get a fresh start, unburdened by regretful decisions from your past.

The process of laser tattoo removal takes time.
Typically you undergo between five and twelve visits, each one lasting about five minutes, over several months.
In each visit a laser breaks down ink particles in your tattoo so that your immune system can remove them.
The tattooed area will become red and swollen soon after treatment, but this eventually settles down.
Sometimes there is some blistering and scabbing.
You will need to take some care to keep the area of the tattoo clean, and to apply some ointments that assist healing.

The [**Liberty Tattoo Removal Program**](Directory.md#Liberty-Tattoo-Removal-Program) offers laser tattoo removal of gang-related, anti-social, or economically limiting tattoos.
You are required to do four hours of community service (or an equivalent financial donation) before each treatment, but there is otherwise no cost.
You must agree to remain clean and sober, and to get no more tattoos, during the treatment.
This service is offered locally, in SLO County.

[**Catholic Charities**](Directory.md#CatholicCharities) has a low-cost tattoo removal program ($20–90 per session, on a sliding scale based on ability to pay).
You must also complete 20 hours of community service before beginning treatment.
They prioritize the removal of offensive or gang-related tattoos, and will remove both visible-and-obvious tattoos (e.g. the face, the back of the hands) and more discreet ones.
Call them to begin the process.

The [Removery INK-nitiative Program](https://removery.com/services/ink-nitiative) offers free removal of tattoos, if those tattoos are in visible areas (face, hands, arms) or suggest gang or hate group affiliation, to people who have ben incarcerated, are former gang members, or are survivors of domestic abuse or human trafficking.
Apply on their website.

The [Jails to Jobs](https://jailstojobs.org/resources/tattoo-removal-programs) website lists hundreds of other free or low-cost tattoo removal programs throughout the country.

### <a id="hospice-and-palliative-care">Hospice and Palliative Care Services</a>

Palliative care is medical treatment that aims to relieve pain and suffering, perhaps alongside medical treatment that hopes to cure or treat some health problem.

### <a id="advance-directives">Advance Directives</a>

Advance Directives are legal documents that let you communicate your healthcare wishes in advance, in case you become unable to speak for yourself.
These documents include:

- **Living Will:** Specifies which medical treatments you would or would not want if you become terminally ill or are in a persistent vegetative state
- **Healthcare Power of Attorney:** Designates a trusted person to make medical decisions for you when you cannot
- **Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) Orders:** Expresses your desire to refuse resuscitation efforts

These documents help to ensure that your healthcare wishes are respected even if you are incapacitated and cannot express them yourself.
It is a good idea to create such documents *before* you need them, as when you need them you will be preoccupied or unable.
Give these documents to your healthcare providers so they know to respect your specific preferences.

The free websites [PREPARE for Your Care](https://prepareforyourcare.org/) and [The Conversation Project](https://theconversationproject.org/) can help you create advance directive documents that match your needs and preferences.

[**Senior Legal Services Project**](Directory.md#Senior-Legal-Services-Project), [**California Rural Legal Assistance (CRLA)**](Directory.md#California-Rural-Legal-Assistance), and [**SLO Legal Assistance Foundation (SLOLAF)**](Directory.md#SLO-Legal-Assistance-Foundation) can give you free help to make your advance directive documents clear and legally binding.

## <a id="ids-and-other-documents">IDs and Other Documents</a> (How to Obtain, Replace, Secure)

Often, agencies and programs will ask you to produce certain documents, like a government identification card (such as a driver’s license), a social security card, a birth certificate, and so forth.
If you have lost such documents, or have never obtained them, this can be an obstacle to working with those agencies and programs.

This subsection of the guide shows you how to obtain or replace documents like these.

### <a id="social-security-numbers-or-cards">Social Security Numbers or Cards</a>

You do not often need your social security card, but you do often need your social security number.
The [**Social Security Administration**](Directory.md#Social-Security-Administration) can help you get a new Social Security card.

If you have an account or are able to create an on-line account at [ssa.gov/myaccount](https://www.ssa.gov/myaccount), you can request a Social Security card on-line and it will be mailed to you.
You can get help with this process by calling [800-772-1213](tel:+1-800-772-1213) (TTY: [800-325-0778](tel:+1-800-325-0778)).

> See [Mail Drops, Post Office Boxes, Etc.](#mail-drops-post-office-boxes-etc) for ways to get mail if you do not have a stable mailing address.

If you are unable to complete this on-line process, you can visit the local Social Security Administration office to get a new card.
It will go more smoothly if you can bring some alternative form of identification like a driver’s license or passport.
In the absence of those, a military ID, employee ID, school ID, or health insurance card might be helpful.

### <a id="id-cards-drivers-licenses">ID Cards and Driver’s Licenses</a>

A state-issued “Real ID,” or a California driver’s license which is also a Real ID, is a useful form of government-issued photo identification card that is widely accepted by a variety of programs, businesses, and service providers.
You get such an identification card from the [**California DMV**](Directory.md#California-DMV).
You must visit the California DMV office to have your photo taken and to submit your paperwork.

You typically first need to already have another identification document (such as a certified birth certificate, a passport, a permanent resident card, a certificate of naturalization or citizenship, or a permanent resident card) as well as documents that demonstrate your California residency (such as a utility bill, tax return, bank statement, or rental agreement that contains your name and address).
There are also fees you typically must pay to obtain either a Real ID or a driver’s license that operates as a Real ID.

However, if you are homeless, you may be able to get a waiver for fees (a “no-fee ID card”), and you may be able to use the address of a homeless shelter or other homeless services agency as your California residency address.
This is true even if you are only temporarily homeless because you are fleeing domestic violence or a similar dangerous situation.
You can only get a simple Real ID (“California Identification Card”) with the no-fee method, not a driver’s license.
Homeless services providers like [**40 Prado Homeless Services Center**](Directory.md#40-Prado), the [**5Cities Homeless Coalition (5CHC)**](Directory.md#5CHC), or the [**El Camino Homeless Organization (ECHO)**](Directory.md#ECHO) can help you with this process.

If you have previously received a Real ID or California driver’s license, but you have lost the card and need to replace it, you can begin this process by visiting [www.edl.dmv.ca.gov/apply](https://www.dmv.ca.gov/wasapp/oddl/oddlApplication.do) or the California DMV office.

### <a id="birth-death-marriage-certificates">Birth, Death, and Marriage Certificates</a>

If you were born in SLO County, you can obtain a copy of your birth certificate from the [**SLO County Clerk-Recorder**](Directory.md#SLO-County-Clerk-Recorder).
You will need to show valid identification (typically, a government-issued photo ID like a driver’s license or passport).

There is also a $32 fee.
However, if you are homeless, you can request an “Affidavit of Homeless Status for Fee Exempt Certified Copy of Birth Certificate.”
You need to sign this and you also need to get a signature from a “homeless services provider.”
This exempts you from having to pay the $32 fee.
Homeless services providers like [**40 Prado Homeless Services Center**](Directory.md#40-Prado), the [**5Cities Homeless Coalition (5CHC)**](Directory.md#5CHC), or the [**El Camino Homeless Organization (ECHO)**](Directory.md#ECHO) can help you with this process.

You can obtain a “certified copy” of a birth certificate for yourself or your child or other close relative.
A certified copy allows you to establish your identity.
Otherwise you can obtain an “informational” copy, which is not valid for establishing identity.
You should understand ahead of time whether or not you need a certified copy, and, if so, you should be sure to ask for one specifically when you order your copy.

You can also use the [VitalChek](https://www.vitalchek.com/v/vital-records/california/san-luis-obispo-county-recorder) website to order an *informational* copy of your birth certificate on-line without visiting the SLO County Clerk-Recorder office.
(You may need to provide a notarized, sworn statement if you want to order a “certified copy” this way, in which case it is probably just as easy to visit the SLO County Clerk-Recorder office.)
That may cost a bit more.

Death records for deaths that occurred in SLO County can also be obtained from the SLO County Clerk-Recorder ($24) or from VitalChek.
Again, there is a difference between “certified” and “informational” copies of death certificates, and you should check which one you need before you order it.
You can typically only get a “certified” copy for a close relative, and you may have to provide additional documentation.

You can also get a copy of a marriage certificate that was issued in SLO County from the SLO County Clerk-Recorder office ($17) or from VitalChek.
Again, there is a difference between “certified” and “informational” copies, and you should check which one you need before you order it.
You can typically only get a “certified” copy for yourself or a close relative, and you may have to provide additional documentation.

There is no homeless fee exemption program for death and marriage certificates the way there is for birth certificates.

If you need a birth, death, or marriage certificate from another county in California, try the [California Department of Public Health’s “Vital Records”](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CHSI/Pages/Vital-Records.aspx) web page.
If you need such records from elsewhere in the U.S. outside California, visit the [National Center for Health Statistics](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/w2w/index.htm) web page.
The VitalChek website can often also get you these records from other areas.

### Tips

#### Document storage and security

- Keep copies separate from originals when possible
- Use document storage services at homeless service centers:
   - [**40 Prado Homeless Services Center**](Directory.md#40-Prado): Call [805-544-4004](tel:+1-805-544-4004) to inquire about document storage options for participants
   - [**5Cities Homeless Coalition**](Directory.md#5CHC): Offers "identification and documentation assistance" as part of client resource center services
   - Note: Services may be limited to active participants; call each center to verify current availability <!-- Source: [5chc.org](https://5chc.org/), [capslo.org](https://capslo.org/) -->
- Consider a safety deposit box if you have any income ($20–40/year typically)
- Scan or photograph documents and store digitally if you have access to email or cloud storage

#### If you have no documents at all

- Start with Social Security Administration—they can try to verify identity through their records
- Contact local legal aid for assistance navigating the process
- California affidavit processes for people with no documents:
   - What it is: Legal process where qualified service providers can verify your identity and housing status through signed affidavits when you lack traditional documents
   - How it works as alternative to documents:
      - Free CA ID cards: Service providers complete "No Fee Identification Card Eligibility Verification" form (DL 933) from DMV; provides free California photo ID
      - Who can verify: School counselors, homeless shelter staff, lawyers, health/mental health/substance use providers, public assistance workers, employment services staff
      - Benefits: Breaks the cycle where you need ID to get housing but need housing to get ID
   - How to access: Contact local emergency shelter, County human services office, or homeless services provider to start the fee waiver process
   - California Process: File forms FL-110, FL-100, FL-160s, FL-311, FL-105, FL-150 at SLO Superior Court (1035 Palm St. Rm 385 or Paso Robles 901 Park St.)

   - Assistance: Self-Help Center [805-706-3617](tel:+1-805-706-3617), online help at calendly.com/self-help-center/, free Q&A webinars via Zoom
   - Requirements: 6-month CA residency, 3-month SLO County residency <!-- Source: [slo.courts.ca.gov](https://www.slo.courts.ca.gov/) -->
- Hospital records of birth may sometimes be used as supporting evidence

## <a id="mail-drops-post-office-boxes-etc">Mail Drops, Post Office Boxes, Etc.</a>

If you are homeless, you may be at a loss when asked for your mailing address.
There are various ways to establish a reliable mailing address even if you do not have a stable living address.

The [**5Cities Homeless Coalition**](Directory.md#5CHC) and [**40 Prado Homeless Services Center**](Directory.md#40-Prado) offices permit clients of their services to use these offices as mailing addresses, and will hold your incoming mail there for you.
Ask them for details.

<!-- NEEDS VERIFICATION
 North County Mail Drop Services (*needs verification*): For people in North County areas (Paso Robles, Atascadero, Templeton), contact [**El Camino Homeless Organization (ECHO)**](Directory.md#ECHO) at [805-462-3663](tel:+1-805-462-3663) to inquire about mail drop services at their Paso Robles (1134 Black Oak Dr.) or Atascadero (7600 El Camino Real #12) locations. Additionally, [**Transitions Mental Health Association (TMHA)**](Directory.md#TMHA) has locations in Arroyo Grande (203 Bridge St.) that may offer mail services for clients; call [805-540-6500](tel:+1-805-540-6500) to inquire. These organizations may allow clients to use their addresses for receiving mail.

You can rent mail boxes from UPS Stores and from the U.S. Postal Service.
The Postal Service option is the most affordable of the two.
But sometimes, a "P.O. Box" address (which is what you get from the Postal Service) is not adequate for your needs, and one advantage of the UPS Store option is that it appears as a regular street address (e.g. "1241 Johnson Avenue #1234, San Luis Obispo").
UPS Store locations with mailbox rental services are available throughout SLO County including:

- Arroyo Grande: 1375 E. Grand Ave. #103, [805-904-6480](tel:+1-805-904-6480)

To confirm which location handles General Delivery in your area, call [800-275-8777](tel:+1-800-275-8777) and request “Customer Service,” or use the [USPS ZIP Code lookup tool](https://tools.usps.com/zip-code-lookup.htm) by entering “General Delivery” as the address line.

You should speak with the postmaster at the post office where you want to receive general delivery mail beforehand.
The post office will hold general delivery mail for you for 30 days.
You must have a valid photo ID to pick up your mail at the post office.
This service is free.
However, this is not a long-term solution; it is meant for temporary use (for instance by travellers passing through town).
The post office may stop accepting general delivery mail for you if you try to use this method for a long time or if you get too much mail.

## <a id="tax-preparation">Tax Preparation</a>

There are several programs that can give you free assistance in filling out and filing your annual tax returns.
Free tax assistance programs are usually available in the February-through-April period.

Even if you do not think you owe any taxes because your income is very low, it can be to your advantage to file a tax return.
This is for a few reasons:

1. You may qualify for certain refundable tax credits that can put money in your pocket, even if you did not pay taxes all year.
1. Some programs for low-income people require those people to show their most recent tax return to prove that they qualify.
1. Filing a tax return, even if it is of no practical effect, can be a gesture of compliance with the law that can be helpful, for example if you are engaged in the U.S. immigration process.

Avoid using commercial tax preparers that charge high fees, or that offer “refund anticipation loans.”
Some of these give poor-quality tax advice, and most of them are bad bargains compared to the free services.

If you are due a tax refund, you will get that refund more quickly if you have a bank account that accepts direct deposit.
The U.S. Internal Revenue Service stopped issuing paper tax refund checks in 2025.

> See the [Banking and Money Management](#banking-and-money-management) section of this guide for help in establishing a bank account.

The national Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) program allows low- and moderate-income people to get free help in preparing and filing their federal and state tax returns.
[**United Way of SLO County**](Directory.md#United-Way) coordinates the local VITA program through various partner organizations, including Cal Poly and [**AARP**](Directory.md#AARP-Tax-Aide).
The AARP Tax-Aide Program is especially for people over age 50.
The United Way also has [an on-line program](https://www.myfreetaxes.org/file-with-virtual-help/) with which you can upload your tax documents and get free help from tax preparation volunteers over the internet.

**County-wide Free Tax Preparation Services** (pending human review):

Free tax preparation is available throughout SLO County during tax season (typically February through mid-April). Services are offered at nine locations including Atascadero, Arroyo Grande, Grover Beach, Los Osos, Morro Bay, Nipomo, Paso Robles, San Luis Obispo, and Templeton. Both VITA (through United Way) and AARP Tax-Aide programs operate by appointment, though some VITA locations accept walk-ins.

- **AARP Tax-Aide**: Nine locations county-wide; appointments available starting late January at [ccfreetax.org](https://www.ccfreetax.org/) or by calling [805-931-6308](tel:+1-805-931-6308); no age requirement or AARP membership needed
- **VITA Program**: Locations include Paso Robles Library (1000 Spring St., Saturdays 9am–3pm, Spanish assistance available select dates) and St. William's Catholic Church in Atascadero (6410 Santa Lucia Rd., Mondays/Fridays 9am–4pm); contact [taxes@unitedwayslo.org](mailto:taxes@unitedwayslo.org) or [805-541-1234](tel:+1-805-541-1234)

Sources: [unitedwayslo.org](https://www.unitedwayslo.org/taxes), [ccfreetax.org](https://www.ccfreetax.org/)

There are also free options that allow you to file your federal income taxes yourself by using guided tax preparation software or by filling in on-line forms and filing them electronically.
See [irs.gov/freefile](https://www.irs.gov/freefile) for details.
Note that the current presidential administration is hostile to this free filing program and so it may be discontinued.

> See the [Internet Access / Email / Digital Access Assistance](#internet-access--email--digital-access-assistance) section of this guide for ways to get access to a computer and the internet.

Homeless people can use the address of a friend, relative, or trusted service provider as their filing address.

> See the [Mail Drops, Post Office Boxes, Etc.](#mail-drops-post-office-boxes-etc) section of this guide for more options for establishing a mailing address.

1. Gig Economy
   1. "Beer Money Sites" / "Get Paid to…" on-line gigs
      - Reddit has an ostensibly curated list of beermoney opportunities [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/ab0dyv/most_common_beer_money_sites_do_not_create/) and a community to discuss options at [r/beermoney](https://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/)
      - What beermoney programs are: Online platforms that pay small amounts of money for simple tasks like taking surveys, watching videos, testing apps, or completing offers. The term "beermoney" comes from earning enough for small extras like buying a beer, not full-time income.
      - How they work: Sign up for websites or apps, complete tasks during your free time, and get paid small amounts (usually $20–200 per month with consistent effort). Popular platforms recommended by Reddit users include Prolific, Freecash, and Cointiply.
      - Important caveats: These are not get-rich-quick schemes. Success requires treating it like part-time work with 30–90 minutes daily commitment. Focus on mastering 2–3 platforms rather than spreading yourself thin. Peak earning times are typically 6–10am and 7–11pm EST when new tasks appear.
      - How this helps people facing homelessness: Can provide small but steady income without needing a fixed address, formal employment, or special skills. Requires internet access and a device (smartphone, tablet, or computer). Good for people who have irregular schedules or cannot commit to traditional work hours.
      - Getting started: Need reliable internet access, email address, and valid ID for most platforms. Start with highly-rated sites from the Reddit community rather than random online ads.

## <a id="miscellaneous-tips">Miscellaneous Tips</a>

1. Ideally contributed by local homeless people: would make for good sidebars to break up listings; may want to get legal waiver of copyright from them, though
   - Use waterproof plastic bags to store important documents and electronics
1. Get assistance at the library:
   - Drop in, or make an appointment by calling/texting [805-540-0057](tel:+1-805-540-0057)
   - Can help you find primary care, recovery, clothing, food, SSDI, shelter, mental health, showers, health insurance
   - (Project of T-MHA / County of SLO Public Libraries)

1. **Weather Patterns and Safety Planning for Unsheltered Individuals**
   - **Dangerous Cold Conditions**: December–February; overnight temperatures can fall below 40°F (warming centers open at 38°F or below)
   - **Dangerous Heat Conditions**: July–August remain the primary extreme heat period; daytime temperatures reach 80–89°F with occasional extremes above 90°F requiring heat emergency response. September can also experience high temperatures (average 77–82°F) with potential extremes—September 2020 saw record temperatures of 113–117°F. October temperatures typically moderate (average highs 74–77°F) but can still reach concerning levels for unsheltered individuals.
      - Historical Context: Temperature extremes above 90°F are relatively rare but do occur, most notably during September heat events. Normal yearly temperature range is 41-78°F.
      - 40 Prado cooling center opens between 8am & 6pm; they have a kennel for pets (all animals must have proof of rabies vaccination)
   - **Rainy Season**: December–February with January having highest precipitation (4+ inches); warming centers open with 50%+ chance of overnight rain
   - **Emergency Shelter Activation**: County warming/cooling centers open when temperatures ≤38°F *or* ≥50% chance of rain *or* dangerous heat conditions per National Weather Service
   - **Regional Considerations**: South County, Atascadero, Morro Bay, and Paso Robles identified as areas with high unsheltered populations needing weather protection
   - **Planning Advice**: Save resources for December–February cold/wet season and July–August extreme heat periods; contact 40 Prado at [805-544-4004](tel:+1-805-544-4004) for warming center status (Note: Unable to verify [805-781-3660](tel:+1-805-781-3660) in available sources; use main 40 Prado number)
