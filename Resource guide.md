## Avoiding, Surviving, and Escaping Homelessness in SLO County

**Note:** This guide is currently in a pre-Beta, unfinished state.
We plan to begin the formal Beta program with complete data by the beginning of 2026.

This guide helps you find free and low-cost resources that can help you if you are experiencing homelessness, are threatened with homelessness, or are just short on money.
It is specific to San Luis Obispo County.

San Luis Obispo County is an especially challenging place for people trying to avoid or to escape homelessness.
Fortunately, there is a lot of help available to people experiencing or threatened with homelessness in SLO County.
Unfortunately, it can be difficult to find this help or to understand how to access it.
This guide makes it easier.

The guide is organized into topics like "Shelter and housing" or "Food".
Each section briefly describes resources available in San Luis Obispo County.
Many of these descriptions contain blue-highlighted, boldface links to the [**Directory**](?section=directory).
This Directory page lists resources in alphabetical order, along with information like the website, phone number, email address, location, and operating hours of the resource.
If you find a resource in the guide that seems it will be useful to you, click the boldface link to go to the directory and find out how to access that resource.

This guide was created by volunteers from [**Shower the People**](Directory.md#Shower-the-People).

## <a id="self-advocacy">Standing Up for Yourself and Communicating with Service Providers</a>

When you meet with case managers and service providers, there are things you can do to make it more likely that they will be able to help you.
This section of the guide gives some good general tips.

### <a id="build-good-relationships">Build Good Relationships with Case Managers and Service Providers</a>

You can get better results by being prepared.
Bring your ID, any paperwork about your situation, and a list of questions or needs.

Be honest and direct when you explain your situation, your needs, and any problems you face.
Ask questions if you need help understanding programs, requirements, or next steps.
When providers help you, tell them you appreciate it.
Good relationships help everyone.

Stay in touch with providers who are especially helpful, even when you’re not actively using their services.

### <a id="manage-appointments">Manage Appointments and Commitments</a>

Set phone alarms or ask for reminder calls when they are available.
Make sure you have a way to get to appointments (see the [Transportation](#transportation) section).
Bring something to do and expect some delays in busy service settings.
If you need to change an appointment, call ahead rather than just not showing up.

Arrive early to appointments if you can.
If you will be late, call ahead.
Keep a simple notebook or use your phone to write down appointments, contacts, and any promises people make to you.
If someone promises to do something for you but you don’t hear back in a reasonable time, check back with them.

### <a id="know-your-rights">Know Your Rights</a>

Many service providers have non-discrimination policies and try to treat people with respect, though policies vary between agencies.
Some services have specific rules about who can use them (like veterans-only programs, or programs with income limits).

Privacy policies vary by agency.
Government agencies (and agencies that get government grants and contracts) often share information through the HMIS (Homeless Management Information System).
You will receive privacy notices before they enter your data, and you can ask to review these notices later.
You may be required to provide some data in order to get services, but you can withhold other information.
Ask about Release of Information (ROI) forms and what they mean before you sign them.

Many programs have procedures for appealing decisions or filing complaints.
Ask program staff or search online to find the specific process.
Legal aid organizations can help with appeals (see the [Legal assistance](#legal-help) section).

### <a id="document-everything">Document Everything</a>

Keep copies of important documents and applications.
Store documents in waterproof bags.
Use your backpack as a pillow when you sleep.
Keep your most important items in clothes pockets.
If you have enough income, consider getting a safety deposit box for the most important or hard-to-replace documents.

Use your phone to take photos of important paperwork.
Turn on automatic cloud backup (iCloud for iPhone, Google Photos for Android) so your photos survive if your phone is lost or stolen.
Phones (iPhones & Androids) typically come with some amount of free cloud storage, so you can keep access to your photos even if you lose your phone.

Write down the dates, names, and outcomes of important conversations.
Keep case numbers, application numbers, and confirmation numbers.

### <a id="focus-on-goals">Focus on Your Goals and Strengths</a>

Tell people clearly what you are working toward (housing, employment, healthcare, etc.).
Share your skills, experience, education, and personal strengths when they matter for the services you want.
For example, tell employment services about your work experience.

Come to meetings with ideas about what might work for your situation.
Follow through on promises you make and take active steps toward your goals.

### <a id="navigate-system-barriers">Navigate System Barriers</a>

Learn the rules for programs: who can use them, when applications are due, and what steps you need to take.
If you don’t qualify for one program, ask about other options.
If you have disabilities or special needs that make it difficult to access a program, ask about help they can provide.

If you’re not getting the help you think you should be getting, ask to speak with supervisors.
Use formal complaint procedures and appeal processes.
Or find someone who knows the system well to help you (like a case manager, behavioral health navigator, legal aid worker, or peer advocate).

### <a id="work-with-multiple-providers">Work with Multiple Service Providers</a>

Tell each provider about other services you get, when it matters.
For example, tell housing programs about your income sources.
But casual services like showers don’t need to know about each other.

If an agency plans to apply for a service in your name, tell them if you already applied on your own.
This prevents duplicate applications and wasted time.
Keep track of which applications you made or that others made for you.
This helps you avoid doing the same thing twice.

Share information with service providers that relates directly to the services you want.
For example, share your income for benefits applications or your medical history for healthcare.
Keep other personal details private if you don’t feel like sharing them.

Keep a list of contact information for all your service providers.
Ask for direct phone numbers or business cards from people who work with you.
This helps you avoid phone trees if you need to call back.

### <a id="set-goals-and-track-progress">Set Goals and Track Progress</a>

Make your goals “S.M.A.R.T.” (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound).
Divide big goals (like getting housing) into smaller steps you can manage.
Notice and celebrate your achievements, even small ones.
Be flexible and willing to change your goals as your situation changes.

### <a id="when-things-go-wrong">When Things Go Wrong</a>

Even when you feel frustrated, stay calm and speak respectfully.
This approach usually gets better results and faster solutions than arguing.
Write down details about problems, including dates, names, and what went wrong.
Don’t give up too soon.
Sticking with it often pays off when you work with complex systems.

### <a id="find-and-use-resources">Find and Use Resources</a>

Use this guide or call [211](tel:+1-211) to get information about available services.
Talk with other people in similar situations—they often have valuable information and tips.

The [Other Guides](#other-guides) section of this guide lists some other resource guides that may have information we missed.

This resource guide shows information that was available when we wrote it.
Things change.
Contact service providers directly to check for the most current information before you travel to their locations.

### <a id="eviction-protection">Eviction Prevention</a>

If you are about to be evicted because you are unable to pay rent, or if you’ve had to move your family into a hotel, you can get immediate financial help from the [**CalWORKs Homeless Assistance Program**](Directory.md#CalWORKs) or the [**Housing Support Program (HSP)**](Directory.md#Housing-Support-Program).
For either of these options, you must first get a referral from the [**SLO County Department of Social Services**](Directory.md#SLO-County-Department-of-Social-Services).

[**5Cities Homeless Coalition (5CHC)**](Directory.md#5CHC) operates a [housing assistance program](https://5chc.org/programs/housing-assistance) that offers financial assistance for rent for people in danger of becoming homeless.
Contact 5CHC to arrange a confidential coordinated entry interview.
You will need to bring identification, including social security cards and birth certificates for you and those living with you, an account of how much income you have received during the previous three months, your lease agreement, and the eviction notice you received.

> See the [Legal Help, Mediation, and Crime Victim Protection](#legal-help) section for options about preventing illegal evictions.

> See the [Emergency Financial Help](#emergency-financial-help) section for more possible ways to get short-term financial help in a crisis.

### <a id="warming-cooling-centers">Warming/Cooling Centers</a>

They offer overnight shelter beds.
Cooling centers open only during the day when the weather is unusually hot.
They offer you an air-conditioned place where you can get out of the sun.
It can be difficult to know on any particular day whether or not these centers are open, so it is a good idea to call ahead.

The SLO city warming/cooling center is at the [**40 Prado Homeless Services Center**](Directory.md#40-Prado).
When it operates as a warming center, check in is between 7pm and 9pm, and you must leave by 8am.
When it operates as a cooling center, you must leave by 6pm.
Meals are provided.
Pets with rabies vaccinations are allowed in their kennel.
People with P.C. 290 convictions are not allowed in the center.
The warming center offers a free hot meal.
There is sometimes transportation available to and from Morro Bay and Los Osos (call for details).

The [**5Cities Homeless Coalition**](Directory.md#5CHC) warming center at <a href="#" class="map-link" data-lat="35.118597" data-lon="-120.594462" data-zoom="17" data-label="5CHC Warming Center">1023 E. Grand Ave. in Arroyo Grande</a> operates between 5:30pm and 7am.
You must check in before 8pm.
Pets are OK if you have proof of license/vaccinations.
You must have a valid ID.
People with P.C. 290 convictions are not allowed in the center.
Call [805-295-1501](tel:+1-805-295-1501) to verify the center is open and to learn about free transportation options to the center.
The warming center offers a free hot meal.
Text “Add Me” to [805-295-1501](sms:+1-805-295-1501?&body=Add%20Me) to receive text updates to your phone when the Warming Center opens, or email [info@5chc.org](mailto:info@5chc.org) and ask to be added to their notification list.

The [**El Camino Homeless Organization (ECHO)**](Directory.md#ECHO) runs a ten-bed warming center at its Paso Robles shelter location.
It operates between 6:00pm and 7:00am. Check in between 4:30pm and 5:30pm.
They will also serve you a meal.
No dogs except for service dogs are allowed in the warming center.

[**Nipomo Senior Center**](Directory.md#Nipomo-Senior-Center) operates an air-conditioned cooling center any time the temperature is above 90°F outside.
You do not have to be a senior center member to shelter there when the cooling center is open.

### <a id="overnight-shelter">Overnight Shelter</a>

If you are unsheltered and need a place to sleep tonight, these are some options:

The [**40 Prado Homeless Services Center**](Directory.md#40-Prado) has a hundred overnight shelter beds.
Many are reserved for people who have previously registered with 40 Prado, but a limited number are available on a walk-in basis.
To get a bed, first come on-site and complete the intake process any day from 8am to 2pm.
Thereafter, on any day when you need an overnight shelter bed, check in from 4:30pm to 6pm to secure a bed or to be placed on the waiting list.
They also offer meals (breakfast, lunch, and dinner), showers, laundry, mail/phone services, an integrated medical clinic (primary and urgent care five days a week with an on-site pharmacy), recuperative care beds, and an animal kennel.
To stay at the shelter, you must have a valid photo ID, you must not be a P.C. 290 registered sex offender, and you must participate in case management.
You musty also be able to care for yourself independently (bathing, feeding, dressing, etc.).
There are a limited number of beds; priority is given to SLO county residents.

The 40 Prado center is the only walk-in, overnight homeless shelter in SLO County.
The [**El Camino Homeless Organization (ECHO)**](Directory.md#ECHO) used to operate a shelter in the north county, but now only offers 90-day transitional housing there ([see below](#transitional-and-long-term-housing)).

There is a shelter in Santa Maria, the [**Good Samaritan Shelter**](Directory.md#Good-Samaritan-Shelter).
They offer 90-day emergency homeless shelter to people from the Santa Maria Valley area.
They also have laundry facilities, hot meals, substance use treatment, and mental health services.
Contact them between 8:30am and 5pm to set up an intake appointment.

If you are homeless because you are escaping dangerous circumstances of domestic violence or sexual assault, you can get safe, confidential, emergency shelter at safe houses operated by [**Lumina Alliance**](Directory.md#Lumina-Alliance).
They will also help you with trained advocacy, accompaniment to medical/legal appointments, case management, and therapy for survivors and children.
They operate throughout SLO County, and are open to people of all genders, ages, and backgrounds.

If you are homeless and have a medically verified need for 24/7 temporary housing because you are seriously ill, recovering from surgery or injury or high-risk pregnancy, or something of that nature, you may qualify for the [**Medically Fragile Homeless Program**](Directory.md#Medically-Fragile-Homeless-Program).
They will help you with immediate housing, supportive services and coordinated case management to ensure physical recovery, access to income sources, connection to services, and a more permanent housing alternative when you exit the program.
You cannot apply for this program yourself, but you must get a referral from an agency like [**Adult Protective Services**](Directory.md#Adult-Protective-Services), [**SLO County Department of Social Services**](Directory.md#SLO-County-Department-of-Social-Services), [**Housing Support Program (HSP)**](Directory.md#Housing-Support-Program), [**Center for Family Strengthening (CSF)**](Directory.md#CSF), or [**CalWORKs**](Directory.md#CalWORKs).
If you are being treated by a hospital or other medical professionals, consider telling them that you are homeless and asking them if they can help you with this process.

If you need shelter because you have a medical condition that requires you to have some medical supervision, you may be able to get a referral to a rehabilitative care or skilled nursing or assistive living facility.
You can get such a referral from your primary care physician.
You may also be able to get some help from [**Adult Protective Services**](Directory.md#Adult-Protective-Services). <!-- Source: Amelia Grove’s “Aging and Levels of Care” presentation at the Collaborative Outreach Meeting on 5 Nov. 2025 -->

#### A Note About “In-Home” Supportive Services
<!-- Note: not sure where this section belongs. I could see a case for it being in the “Medical/Health” section, or maybe in the section on services for particular groups (e.g. elderly/disabled/blind). People who are looking for this information seem unlikely to search for it by going to the the “Housing” section. -->

The [**In-Home Supportive Services (IHSS)**](Directory.md#In-Home-Supportive-Services) Program helps pay for services provided to senior, blind, or disabled people who have difficulty caring for themselves and cannot live at home safely without in-home care.
Despite the “in-home” name, this program is potentially also available to people who shelter at homeless shelters or safe-parking sites.<!-- according to the long-term care ombudsman at the Collaborative Outreach Meeting on 5 Nov 2025 -->
Among the services that this program can help pay for are meal preparation, laundry, grocery shopping, personal care services (such as bowel and bladder care, bathing, grooming and paramedical services, help getting dressed, help getting into and out of a wheelchair), and accompaniment to medical appointments.

To qualify for IHSS, you must be disabled, blind, or age 65 or older.
You must also be unable to live safely in your current home or shelter environment without assistance, and you must be financially needy.
The process of applying for IHSS is difficult, so it is a good idea for you to get some help from a case manager or other social worker.

### <a id="transitional-and-long-term-housing">Transitional and Long-Term Housing</a>

This section discusses more long-term housing options including *transitional housing* (a temporary home while you search for more long-term housing) and *affordable housing* or *subsidized housing* (a long-term home).

The [**Coordinated Entry System (CES)**](Directory.md#CES) is SLO county’s system for matching people in need with transitional or long-term housing that is appropriate for them.
If you want to get such housing, you should try to enter this system.
This can be more effective than trying to contact the many individual transitional or long-term housing programs one at a time.
To enter this system, contact one of the many participating agencies, such as [**SLO County Department of Social Services**](Directory.md#SLO-County-Department-of-Social-Services), [**5Cities Homeless Coalition**](Directory.md#5CHC), [**Community Action Partnership San Luis Obispo (CAPSLO)**](Directory.md#CAPSLO), [**Transitions Mental Health Association**](Directory.md#TMHA), [**Good Samaritan Shelter**](Directory.md#Good-Samaritan-Shelter), or [**SLO County Health Department**](Directory.md#SLO-County-Health-Department).

A program called [**Housing Now**](Directory.md#Housing-Now) finds homes for the most vulnerable chronically homeless people from SLO County.
You cannot apply directly to participate in this program, but if you enter the Coordinated Entry System (see above), that system may eventually place you in this program so that you can quickly get a home.

The [**Behavioral Health Bridge Housing (BHBH)**](Directory.md#BHBH) has some quality, affordable short-term (less than 90 days) and medium term (90 days to two years) housing for people in SLO county who have severe behavioral health issues who are homeless or at risk of homelessness.
For information on the application process, how to demonstrate eligibility, and bed availability call Mark Lamore, Director of Homeless Services at [**Transitions Mental Health Association (TMHA)**](Directory.md#TMHA), at [805-540-6500](tel:+1-805-540-6500).

[**5Cities Homeless Coalition (5CHC)**](Directory.md#5CHC) operates a [housing assistance program](https://5chc.org/programs/housing-assistance) that offers case management and financial assistance for rent, deposit, and immediate needs, and housing assistance through various funding grants.
This is available both to currently homeless people and to people in danger of becoming homeless.
Contact 5CHC to arrange a confidential coordinated entry interview.

[**El Camino Homeless Organization (ECHO)**](Directory.md#ECHO) operates transitional (90-day) shelters in Atascadero and Paso Robles that serve people experiencing homelessness.
People who live in these shelters also get individualized case management services to help them find employment and long-term housing.
There is often a long waiting list for shelter beds.
They will not admit P.C. 290 registered sex offenders.

The [**CalWORKs Homeless Assistance Program**](Directory.md#CalWORKs) can pay a one-time security deposit and/or last month’s rent and/or utility deposit for families who are homeless or who have received a “Pay Rent or Quit” notice on their current rental home.
To qualify you must meet CalWORKs eligibility requirements and have less than $100 in liquid assets.

[**Family Care Network**](Directory.md#Family-Care-Network)’s [**Housing Support Program (HSP)**](Directory.md#Housing-Support-Program) provides financial assistance for housing deposits and rent to families that are experiencing homelessness or are at risk of homelessness in SLO County.
They also offer case management and life skills workshops (budgeting, credit repair, communication), bus passes, gas cards, and paperwork assistance.

[**Balay Ko on Barka**](Directory.md#Balay-Ko-on-Barka) (a.k.a. “My Home for Hope”) and [**Cabins for Change**](Directory.md#Cabins-for-Change), both in Grover Beach, operate many individual “tiny homes” that serve as transitional (90–180 days) housing.
The cabins come with 24/7 support, case management, connections to food services and recovery, and house stabilization guidance.
They have on-site laundry and showers.
They accept pets.
They typically have a long waiting list.
Apply through [**5Cities Homeless Coalition**](Directory.md#5CHC) to get on the waiting list.

[**Housing Authority of SLO (HASLO)**](Directory.md#HASLO) operates several affordable housing properties in SLO county.
Typically in these projects, residents pay a portion of the rent, while the rest of the rent is paid for them by subsidies or vouchers.
To qualify to rent one of these housing units, you must have enough income to pay your portion of the rent, but you must not have so much income that you could afford non-subsidized housing.
Typically this means households that earn less than 30% of the area median income.
Preference is given to SLO County residents and to veterans. Some housing is restricted to seniors (age 62 and above).
You need to provide proof of income and your prior rental history.
Most of these housing units have wait lists, and only some of them accept new applications at any time.

[**Paso Robles Housing Authority**](Directory.md#Paso-Robles-Housing-Authority) operates several affordable housing properties in Paso Robles designed for people who have around 30–60% of the area median income.
You can fill out an application on their website. If your application is accepted, you will be put on the waiting list.
You must include copies of the latest three months’ paycheck stubs, proof of other sources of income, and a copy of your last two years’ federal income tax returns.
You may be rejected if you have recently been evicted, have defaulted on debts, or have certain criminal convictions.

[**Lumina Alliance**](Directory.md#Lumina-Alliance) operates a six- to 24-month [transitional housing program](https://luminaalliance.org/transitional-housing/) for individuals and families who are fleeing domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and/or stalking.
People housed through this program also get access to advocacy services, employment assistance, counseling, legal help, children’s services, life skills development, and help obtaining permanent housing.
If you are homeless or in need of housing due to fleeing abusive situation, have low or very low income, and are willing to participate in Lumina’s program and to cooperate with them in following a safety plan, you may qualify for transitional housing through this program.

Adults in SLO County who live with mental illness may qualify for supportive housing in multiple county locations through the [**Transitions Mental Health Association (TMHA)**](Directory.md#TMHA) [residential housing program](https://www.t-mha.org/program-details.php?id=6).

The [**HomeShare SLO**](Directory.md#HomeShare-SLO) program matches property owners who have an extra room with people who need a place to live.
They have a “reduced rent task exchange” program with which you can do 8–15 hours of work per week to get a rent reduction.

[**Restorative Partners**](Directory.md#Restorative-Partners) runs a [housing program](https://restorativepartners.org/housing/) with multiple transitional housing programs for men, women, and families in various SLO County locations.
These programs are for people in recovery from addiction and people transitioning from incarceration.
Some are specific to women with children.
Along with housing, residents get help with employment support, financial literacy, life skills, addiction recovery, and help finding permanent housing.
There is a wait list.

[**Salvation Army**](Directory.md#Salvation-Army) has a “Rapid Rehousing Program” that helps people find and qualify for long-term housing.

The [**HouseKeys**](Directory.md#HouseKeys) program is the city of SLO’s affordable home-ownership program.
It serves households who bring in about 30–50% of the area median income.
Their idea of “affordable” may not be yours.
If you want to apply for housing through this program, begin the [application process](https://www.housekeys.org/applicationprocess) described on their website.

[**Habitat for Humanity SLO County**](Directory.md#Habitat-for-Humanity) operates a home ownership program for first-time low-income home buyers and home preservation assistance (minor repairs, landscaping, painting) for low-income homeowners.
Apply via their website.

[**Peoples’ Self-Help Housing**](Directory.md#Peoples-Self-Help-Housing) operates a “sweat equity” homeownership program in which families help to build their own homes.
They also operate affordable rental housing developments and supportive housing programs.
They serve low-income families, farmworkers, seniors, veterans, people with disabilities, and formerly-homeless people.
Contact them directly to access the program.

Some other low-income options include:

- [Roosevelt Family Apartments](https://www.rooseveltfamilyapts.com/) in Nipomo.
- [San Luis Bay Apartments](https://www.gsfpi.com/) in Nipomo.

If you are a refugee from another country, you may be able to get some help establishing housing from [**SLO for HOME**](Directory.md#SLO4Home).

#### For Seniors

<!-- Note: the “Assisted Living Waiver” program is not available in SLO yet. There are no Assisted Living / Residential Care For the Elderly (RCFE) facilities in SLO County that accept Medi-Cal. If you need a Medi-Cal facility of that type, you’ll have to go out of the area. Source: Amelia Grover’s presentation at the 5 Nov. 2025 Collaborative Outreach meeting -->

[**Housing Authority of SLO (HASLO)**](Directory.md#HASLO), [**Paso Robles Housing Authority**](Directory.md#Paso-Robles-Housing-Authority), and [**Peoples’ Self-Help Housing**](Directory.md#Peoples-Self-Help-Housing) operates several affordable senior housing rental properties.

There are some additional subsidized and affordable housing options especially for seniors (sometimes defined as age 55 and above, or as 62 and above).
These include:

- [Cortina d’Arroyo Grande Senior Apartments](https://cortinadarroyograndeseniorapts.com/) (<a href="#" class="map-link" data-lat="35.122208" data-lon="-120.607207" data-zoom="17" data-label="Cortina d’Arroyo Grande Senior Apartments">241 N.

- Parkview Manor (<a href="#" class="map-link" data-lat="35.113380" data-lon="-120.600175" data-zoom="17" data-label="Parkview Manor">365 South Elm St., Arroyo Grande</a>) — [805-489-5101](tel:+1-805-489-5101)
- [**Judson Terrace**](Directory.md#Judson-Terrace) (SLO), has 107 low-income affordable apartments for people aged 55 and up, and 31 low-income affordable apartments for people aged 62 and up. They only accept applications when the waiting list is open.

Affordable housing options for seniors with Section 8 vouchers include:

- Morro del Mar Senior Apartments (<a href="#" class="map-link" data-lat="35.363321" data-lon="-120.849837" data-zoom="17" data-label="Morro del Mar Senior Apartments">555 Main St., Morro Bay</a>) — [805-225-1837](tel:+1-805-225-1837)

- [Las Brisas Retirement Community](https://www.sunshineretirementliving.com/las-brisas-independent-senior-living-san-luis-obispo-ca/) (SLO)

Affordable housing options for disabled / handicapped seniors can be found at:

- California Manor (<a href="#" class="map-link" data-lat="35.462401" data-lon="-120.645271" data-zoom="17" data-label="California Manor">10165 El Camino Real, Atascadero</a>) — [805-466-0759](tel:+1-805-466-0759)

You can find additional [senior housing listings](https://centralcoastseniors.org/senior-independent-housing-options/) at the [**Central Coast Commission for Senior Citizens**](Directory.md#Central-Coast-Commission-for-Senior-Citizens) website.

If you need Assistive Living or Residential Care for the Elderly (RCFE) housing, there are some options in SLO County, but none of them accept Medi-Cal.
If you need such housing and Medi-Cal is your only health insurance, you can get on a waiting list for a facility outside of SLO County.
This is a lengthy process, so if you think you might need such a living situation in the future (even as long as a year or more from now), you should try to start this process now.
Discuss this with your case manager if you have one, or with the [**Long-Term Care Ombudsman**](Directory.md#Long-Term-Care-Ombudsman).

#### Future Possibilities

The projects in this subsection are not yet housing people but hope to do so soon.

[**Waterman Village**](Directory.md#Waterman-Village) is a tiny home community in SLO city designed for low- to very-low-income residents, primarily single seniors.
As of November 2025 the project is still under construction and is not admitting residents.

[**Welcome Home Village**](Directory.md#Welcome-Home-Village) is a combination of permanent supportive housing units (40 units) and interim supportive housing units (14 units) that will be operated by [**Good Samaritan Shelter**](Directory.md#Good-Samaritan-Shelter) in SLO city on county-owned land.
Priority is given to Bob Jones Bike Trail encampment residents.
As of November 2025 the project is still under construction and is not admitting residents.

Restorative Partners is creating a [**Healing and Restoration Campus**](Directory.md#Healing-and-Restoration-Campus) near Laguna Lake in SLO, which is meant to have 34 private bedrooms and shared communal facilities.
It will also offer job training and support.
It is designed specifically for people reentering society from incarceration.

[**Hope’s Village**](Directory.md#Hopes-Village) is a proposed tiny home community meant for chronically homeless people, prioritizing for veterans, women, and elderly with little or no income.
As of November 2025 the project is still looking for a suitable location (and has been for over a decade); they are not admitting residents.

The [Balay Ko Family Resource Center](https://www.echoshelter.org/buildinghopeandhome) in Atascadero hopes to add 30 shelter beds for families to what is currently offered by [**El Camino Homeless Organization (ECHO)**](Directory.md#ECHO)

### <a id="housing-veterans">For U.S. Military Veterans</a>

U.S. military veterans who have low incomes and who are homeless or at risk of homelessness can get help from [**Supportive Services for Veteran Families**](Directory.md#Supportive-Services-for-Veteran-Families).
This help includes housing assistance, case management, and financial assistance; rapid re-housing and homelessness prevention services; temporary financial assistance for rent, deposits, and utilities; housing barriers assessments, emergency housing stability assistance, housing counseling, rental agreement education, landlord-tenant mediation, and future housing stability planning.
You must have a DD214 with discharge other than dishonorable.

The [**RVs for Veterans**](Directory.md#RVs-for-Veterans) program can get you a free RV (e.g. motorhome, travel trailer, or fifth wheel).
These are donated by other members of the community, and are available as they are donated.
Contact them to be put on a waiting list for the next RV.
Priority is given to homeless veterans, veterans who receive insufficient benefits to pay rent, veterans who do not qualify for VA assistance, and veterans who need to live alone because of PTSD.
Sometimes the program also has RVs available for people who are experiencing homelessness who are not veterans.
The RVs are in working condition, with no leaks; you must obtain insurance.

Homeless veterans can get help from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s V.A. Supportive Housing (VASH) program, which can give you vouchers to pay for permanent housing.
Call [877-4AID-VET](tel:+1-877-424-3838) or ask for help from [**SLO County Veterans Services**](Directory.md#Veterans-Services).

> See [Automobile Insurance and Repair](#auto-insurance-and-repair) for tips on how to obtain low-cost auto insurance.

### <a id="sober-living-homes">Sober Living Homes and Residential Treatment Options</a>

[**SLO Hub**](Directory.md#SLO-Hub) helps you find a residential (live-in) recovery program that’s right for you, and can pay the deposit and rent for the opening months of your residency if you cannot afford it or if your insurance does not cover it.

[**SLO County Behavioral Health Department**](Directory.md#SLO-County-Behavioral-Health) contracts with sober living environments throughout SLO County (from Oceano to Paso Robles) at rates of $35–55 per day.
These facilities accept Medi-Cal and offer sliding scale fees based on ability to pay.
Contact their access line at [800-838-1381](tel:+1-800-838-1381) for referrals.

Here are some residential treatment options in our area:
<!-- Note: “Sober Living West” is sometimes advertised as a SLO option, but it’s in Playa Del Rey, and besides does not accept insurance apparently -->
<!-- Note: Restorative Partners runs some sober living homes in the area, but these are specifically designed for people reentering society from jail/prison custody -->

- [**Tikva Treatment**](Directory.md#Tikva-Treatment) (Arroyo Grande) — also known as “The Haven at Pismo” or “Mesa House"; accepts private insurance and self-pay

## <a id="property-storage">Property Storage Options</a>

### <a id="short-term-property-storage">Short-Term</a>

If you need to securely store a small amount of property for a few hours or overnight, you have a few options:

The [**40 Prado Homeless Services Center**](Directory.md#40-Prado) has storage lockers available for people who have completed intake for day services there.
You must provide your own padlock.
<!-- Note: Unable to determine specific locker sizes, conditions of use, or whether document storage is available from publicly available sources (as of October 2025); contact 40 Prado directly at [805-544-4004](tel:+1-805-544-4004) for details -->

The commercial service [Bounce](https://bounce.com/) partners with multiple locations (in SLO County, these are typically UPS Stores) to offer short-term luggage storage that typically runs about $7 per day or $20–80 per month (depending on weight and size).
You can find the specific locations, terms and conditions, and costs at their website.

In a few locations in SLO County (Morro St. in SLO, at Cal Poly, and at the Curbaril Park-n-Ride in Atascadero) you can find [on-demand bike lockers](https://rideshare.org/bike-lockers/).
These cost 5¢ per hour and can be rented for up to seven consecutive days.
Use the [BikeLink](https://www.bikelink.org/) app to access and pay for these lockers.
They are for bicycles only (you cannot use them to store other personal belongings like carts or suitcases), but you can probably get away with storing pannier bags along with your bicycle.

### <a id="long-term-property-storage">Long-Term</a>

There are several commercial long-term storage options in SLO County.
You can find these by doing a web search for terms like “self storage” or “mini storage”.
They typically rent spaces by the month, and have different-sized units available at different prices.
5′×5′, 5′×10′, and 10′×10′ units are typical.
You can expect to pay about $60–75 per month for the least-expensive and smallest sizes, up to $150 for larger sizes.
Most storage facilities have daytime hours of operation when you can access the storage units to add or remove property, and are closed to everyone at night.

### <a id="recovering-seized-property">Recovering Property Taken During Arrests or Encampment Sweeps</a>

<!-- To-do: see if you can get more specific policies from the county, parks service, CalTrans, other municipalities, and other law-enforcement agencies -->

Different agencies take responsibility for clearing homeless camps, depending on where the camps are located.
These agencies have different policies about whether, to what extent, and for how long they will store property that they clear from encampments, so that the owners of that property can recover it.

They typically will only store certain items of property, and will throw away things that are hazardous, soiled, or decayed or that seem to them like mere trash.
They often store all items taken from an encampment sweep in one big pile, which can make it difficult for you to find your own items.

Grover Beach will post a notice *after* they do an encampment sweep, at the encampment’s former location, “stating where the personal property is being stored, and listing the phone number and hours a person claiming ownership can collect or make arrangements to collect their personal property.”
They will store some belongings for 90 days before discarding them.

Morro Bay stores some property taken during encampment sweeps for 90 days before discarding it.
Their policy is to post a notice where they plan to do encampment sweeps 72 hours before they begin, and those notices should include the address, phone number, and operating hours of the location where personal property will be stored.

SLO City stores some property taken during encampment sweeps for 90 days before discarding it.
If you have had property taken in this way, call either the Public Works Department ([805-781-7220](tel:+1-805-781-7220)) or the Ranger Service Department ([805-781-7302](tel:+1-805-781-7302)) and give them a detailed description of your property.
If they think they may have it, you can make an appointment to retrieve it.

If your property was seized from an camp sweep along the highway, on-ramp / off-ramp, or overpass / underpass, this may have been done by CalTrans.
CalTrans is supposed to store some property for 60 days after removing it.
They should post notices where they plan to do encampment sweeps 48 hours before they begin, and those notices should include a phone number you can call to get assistance in retrieving your property.

If a different agency from those was responsible for the sweep, try discovering which agency it was, and then contact them directly.

If you were separated from your property because you were arrested, it is possible that those who arrested you did not make any attempt to secure your belongings.
They may have just left them wherever they were when you were arrested.
If they did secure your belongings, they should return these to you when you are released from jail or they should tell you the process you can use to retrieve them, unless they are keeping the property as evidence.

In the case of the SLO County Sheriff, if they were keeping the property as evidence but then decide to return it to you, they will inform you by sending you a letter that tells you where to pick up the property.
You then have 30 days to retrieve the property, or it may be destroyed.
If you do not have a stable mailing address, or if the Sheriffs Department does not know your mailing address, you may never see this letter!
In such a case, you may want to contact the Sheriffs department to let them know how to contact you if they decide to release your property.

### <a id="free-food-pantries">Free Food Pantries</a>

Food pantries give away unprepared food (such as fresh produce, canned goods, and packaged food).
Some pantries have special no-cook, no-refrigeration, ready-to-eat options for people who do not have access to kitchens.
Some give you a pre-prepared box or bag of food, others allow you to select particular items you want.

### <a id="little-free-pantries">Little Free Pantries</a>

Little free pantries are small boxes erected in neighborhoods and maintained by the people who live nearby.
They are self-serve and open 24/7.
They are stocked by people who have extra things to give away.
You never know quite what you will find there, but there is usually some canned and packaged non-perishable food, and sometimes toiletries and other small essentials.

Sometimes people put perishable food in little free pantries, but you should beware of eating such food as it may have been there for a while and may no longer be safe to eat.

See [**Little Free Pantries**](Directory.md#Little-Free-Pantries) in the [Directory](Directory.md) for a list of locations.

### <a id="food-box-distributions">Food Box Distributions</a>

The [**SLO Food Bank**](Directory.md#SLO-Food-Bank) gives away food boxes on a regular schedule at a variety of locations in SLO County.
Visit [findfoodslo.org](https://findfoodslo.org/) for a complete list and schedule of these “Neighborhood Food Distributions.”

### <a id="summer-meal-sites">Summer Meal Sites (for Children)</a>

The California Department of Education has a “Summer Food Service Program” to help children during the Summer school break who usually get meals at school.
This program is open to all children in the community.
You can find a list of [Summer Meal Sites in San Luis Obispo County](https://www.cde.ca.gov/ds/sh/sn/ap/summersites.asp?year=2025&countyname=San_Luis_Obispo) at the California Department of Education website.

### <a id="senior-meal-programs">Senior Meal Programs</a>

[**Meals that Connect**](Directory.md#Meals-that-Connect) has several sites in SLO County where they serve free, hot communal lunches every weekday.
The program is for people aged 60 and above.
You must fill out an application to join the program, and you must reserve your meals two days in advance.
They also can deliver meals to your home if you are homebound.

[**Five Cities Meals on Wheels**](Directory.md#5Cities-Meals-on-Wheels) is a similar program specific to the Five Cities area that provides daily meals, delivered to the homes of people who cannot prepare nutritious meals for themselves and do not have caretakers who can do so.
They serve homebound neighbors in Arroyo Grande, Grover Beach, Oceano, Pismo Beach, and Shell Beach.
They serve seniors and people with temporary or permanent disabilities.

Low-income seniors (aged 60 and above) can get $20–50 in credit to use at participating farmers markets from the California Department of Food and Agriculture.
There is limited availability, so if the program runs out of credits you may have to wait until their next budget to apply.
Learn more about the program and apply to join it at [their website](https://www.cdfa.ca.gov/SeniorFarmersMrktNutritionPrgm/).

### <a id="calfresh-ebt-wic">CalFresh / EBT (Food Stamps) and WIC</a>

The CalFresh program is California’s version of the federal nutrition program known as “SNAP” or “food stamps.”
If you have a low income, California gives you an “EBT card” which you can use like a debit card at grocery stores and farmers markets to buy healthy foods.

You can apply for CalFresh on-line at either of the following sites:

- [BenefitsCal.com](https://benefitscal.com/)
- [GetCalFresh.org](https://www.getcalfresh.org/)

You can also apply in person at the [**SLO County Department of Social Services**](Directory.md#SLO-County-Department-of-Social-Services).

If you are a Cal Poly student, you can get assistance from the [Cal Poly CalFresh Program](https://www.calfreshcalpoly.org/).

You will need some identification document, proof of income, and (for students) indication of student status, and (for non-citizens) immigration status.
Suitable proof of income includes pay stubs from last 30 days, an employer letter on company letterhead, tax forms (1040, W-2, 1099), self-employment profit/loss statement or ledger, or a signed written statement if you do not have those documents.
See [calfresh.guide](https://calfresh.guide/verifications-the-calfresh-office-requires/) for more details.

Some local farmers markets will double up to $15 in CalFresh benefits that you spend at the market, so you can get twice as much food for your money.
See [slocountyfarmers.org](https://www.slocountyfarmers.org/snap) for details.

The [**Women, Infants, and Children (WIC)**](Directory.md#WIC) program also provides E-WIC debit cards with which you can buy certain types of food from farmers markets and WIC-approved groceries.

### <a id="edible-wild-plants">Edible Wild Plants</a>

There are many edible wild plants available in SLO County.
When they are in season, they can add nutrition to your diet.

**Warning:** Some wild plants are poisonous.
You should only forage for wild plants if you know what you are doing.
Also: beware of foraging plants in agricultural or well-tended areas, as they may have been treated with pesticides.
Don’t forage plants from waste sites, stagnant water areas, or areas subject to agricultural or industrial run-off, as the plants may take up toxins or parasites from the soil or water.

Some common edible plants in SLO County are:

| [Wild Mustard](https://ediblewild.info/plants/mustard)                             | Spring        | Flowers and leaves |

Sometimes you will also see edible fruit trees like plums or cherries on sidewalks, in parks, or in other public places.

Sometimes also people plant fruit trees on their own property but then neglect to harvest the fruit, perhaps because there is more than they need.
In such a case you can ask the property owner for permission to harvest from their trees.

## <a id="refill-a-water-bottle">Where to Refill a Water Bottle</a>

Most major parks and recreation facilities have water fountains and/or water bottle refill stations, as do some public libraries.

The city of SLO also has a water bottle filling station network.
Some of these stations are inside buildings and are only accessible when the building is open for business.
Others are outside and are available 24/7.
You can find a map of these hydration stations [at this link](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/ac825840143c4d718e06397d5306fa89) or at [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?mid=1ojOfK6l3mkAh6JIfFJZwA5ej5Qj232No&ll=35.27079109833796%2C-120.65453885&z=15).

[Runabout Paratransit](https://www.slorta.org/services/runabout-paratransit/) is a county-wide transit service for people who cannot always use the fixed-route SLO RTA buses because of disability.
This service will take you door-to-door within ¾-mile of the RTA fixed routes during the same hours RTA operates.
One personal care attendant can accompany you free-of-charge.
You have to apply and have an in-person interview to be eligible for this service (call [805-781-4833](tel:+1-805-781-4833) or visit <a href="#" class="map-link" data-lat="35.256974" data-lon="-120.672616" data-zoom="17" data-label="SLO RTA">253 Elks Lane, SLO</a>, M–Th 8am–4pm, or Fri. by appointment).
After you register, make ride reservations 1–7 days in advance by calling [805-541-2544](tel:+1-805-541-2544).
Rides are not free; they cost about twice as much as ordinary RTA rides.
However people who qualify to use Runabout Paratransit can also ride the ordinary RTA service for free.

[**SLO Transit**](Directory.md#SLO-Transit) is the within-city San Luis Obispo bus system.
You can use the [SLO Transit RiderPortal](https://slo.rider.peaktransit.com/) website or phone app ([iPhone](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/slo-transit/id458554556?mt=8), [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=edu.calpoly.android.SloBusMapper&hl=en)) to view routes and to see when the next bus is due to arrive.
You can buy bus passes on the bus or by using the [Token Transit](https://tokentransit.com/riders/download) app.
(Another option for viewing bus arrival times and for planning travel is the [moovit](https://moovitapp.com/index/en/public_transit-San_Luis_Obispo_CA-4003) app.)
There are discounts for seniors and disabled people (you may need to [apply for a special card](https://forms.slocity.org/Forms/SDPassApp)), and for children.
If you buy a regional day pass from SLO RTA, that also lets you ride SLO Transit buses.

Some service providers can give you a bus pass if you cannot afford to buy one.
For example, [**Catholic Charities**](Directory.md#Catholic-Charities) and the [**Society of St. Vincent de Paul**](Directory.md#Society-of-St-Vincent-de-Paul) often have bus passes available to people who need them.
Clients of [**Tri-Counties Regional Center**](Directory.md#Tri-Counties-Regional-Center) can get bus passes from them.
The [**Family Care Network**](Directory.md#Family-Care-Network) can help you get a bus pass if you cannot afford one on your own (you may first need to get a referral from a [**SLO County Department of Social Services**](Directory.md#SLO-County-Department-of-Social-Services) Employment Resource Specialist).

You can find carpool options locally by using the [iRideshare](https://irideshare.org/#/) web application, a free program for SLO County commuters.
The application matches commuters based on their locations, routes, destinations, and schedules to try to match them into compatible carpools.

If you register for iRideshare and you commute to work by walking, biking, taking the bus, or in a carpool or vanpool, and you need to get home from work in some other way (for example, because the carpool is leaving at the wrong time, or because your bike broke down), the [Guaranteed Ride Home](https://rideshare.org/program/guaranteed-ride-home/) program will pay for your taxi, Uber, or Lyft ride home.
(You need to save the receipt, and you can only get a limited number of guaranteed rides home.)

There are [Dial-A-Ride](https://www.slorta.org/services/dial-a-ride/) services in Atascadero, Morro Bay, Nipomo, Paso Robles, Shandon, and Templeton.
They typically offer curb-to-curb service and charge $2.25–8.00 each way (sometimes less for seniors, disabled people, and children):

If you expect you will need to stop at a pharmacy after your appointment, say so when you make your shuttle reservation.
Make a shuttle reservation at least three days before your medical appointment by calling [855-659-4600](tel:+1-855-659-4600).

If you are a [**Community Health Centers of the Central Coast (CHC)**](Directory.md#CHC) patient, and you need a ride to your CHC appointment, you can get shuttle service.
The CHC Shuttle picks you up at your location and drops you off at the clinic, then returns you after your appointment.
To use the shuttle, you should have a CHC appointment and live in the area of the CHC clinic.
CHC may also give you an RTA bus pass to help you get to your appointment.
Make a reservation at least 48 hours before your appointment by calling [877-743-3242](tel:+1-877-743-3242).
They will call you back within 24 hours to confirm your reservation.

Veterans who travel to VA health care facilities for VA-authorized appointments can get free curb-to-curb shuttle service through [**Veterans Transportation Service (VTS)**](Directory.md#Veterans-Transportation-Service).

### <a id="bicycles">Bicycles</a>

The [**Bike Kitchen**](Directory.md#Bike-Kitchen) in SLO city can help you learn how to do maintenance and repairs on your bicycle, and can give you access to the tools and supplies you need.
They also sell refurbished bicycles at low prices.
Visit their website to see their current schedule.
They charge a small fee ($5) to use their repair/maintenance services.

Here are some tips for keeping your bike safe if you are camping:

- Lock bikes together when you camp with multiple people.
- Position your bike near your tent and thread one of the tent’s guy-lines through the wheel, so your tent will shake if someone moves the bike.
- Use multiple locks (for example, a U-lock and a cable). Avoid using cable locks only, as they are relatively easy to break.
- Consider using a lock that makes an audible alarm when it is tampered with.

### <a id="auto-insurance-and-repair">Automobile Insurance and Repair</a>

A car must be insured to be legally driven in California.
California has a state-sponsored, low-cost auto insurance program.

- no at-fault accidents involving bodily injury or death on a driving record within the previous three years, and
- no felony or misdemeanor convictions for a violation of the Vehicle Code on your motor vehicle driving record.

You can apply for this insurance on-line at [mylowcostauto.com](https://www.mylowcostauto.com) or by calling [866-602-8861](tel:+1-866-602-8861).

The [**Family Care Network**](Directory.md#Family-Care-Network) can help you pay for car repairs, payments, and gas if you’re broke.
You may first need to get a referral from a [**SLO County Department of Social Services**](Directory.md#SLO-County-Department-of-Social-Services) Employment Resource Specialist.

The [California Bureau of Automotive Repair (CAP)](https://www.bar.ca.gov/cap)’s “Consumer Assistance Program” can help you fix your car so that it satisfies California emissions standards.

### <a id="emergency-care">Emergency Care</a>

#### When and How to Call 911

Call 911 immediately when someone needs emergency medical care that cannot wait.
This includes when a person:

- Cannot breathe or struggles severely to breathe
- Has no pulse or appears unconscious and unresponsive
- Bleeds heavily and cannot stop the bleeding
- Shows signs of stroke (sudden face drooping, arm weakness, or speech difficulty)
- Experiences chest pain that might indicate a heart attack
- Has a severe allergic reaction with swelling or breathing problems
- Suffers a serious injury
- Takes a dangerous overdose of a drug or poison
- Has a seizure (especially if it lasts longer than five minutes or if the person has never had a seizure before)
- Has a severe mental health crisis in which they are an immediate danger to themselves or others

Stay calm and speak clearly to the 911 dispatcher.
The dispatcher will guide you through the process, and may ask you for:

- **Your exact location** — Give the full address, including apartment number, floor, or any access instructions. If you’re unsure of the address, describe nearby landmarks or cross streets.
- **The nature of the emergency** — Briefly describe what happened and the person’s current condition.
- **The patient’s condition** — Report whether the person is conscious, breathing, and responsive. Describe visible injuries or symptoms.
- **Your relationship to the patient** — State whether you are family, a friend, or a bystander.
- **Your contact information** — Provide a phone number where responders can reach you.

Do not hang up until the dispatcher tells you to.
The dispatcher may tell you how to provide care while you wait for help to arrive.
If the situation changes while you wait, call 911 again immediately to update them.

Stay with the patient until help arrives, if it is safe for you to do so.
Choose someone to watch for the ambulance and to guide responders to the location.

#### Emergency Rooms

There are four emergency rooms in our area:

1. [**Arroyo Grande Community Hospital**](Directory.md#Arroyo-Grande-Community-Hospital) (Arroyo Grande)
1. [**Adventist Health Sierra Vista**](Directory.md#Adventist-Health-Sierra-Vista) (SLO)
1. [**French Hospital Medical Center**](Directory.md#French-Hospital-Medical-Center) (SLO)
1. [**Adventist Health Twin Cities**](Directory.md#Adventist-Health-Twin-Cities) (Templeton)

These emergency rooms are open all day, every day.

Do not worry if your Medi-Cal paperwork is not yet in order.
Under the “Hospital Presumptive Eligibility” program, in an emergency, hospitals will treat you as though you have Medi-Cal for up to two months while they work with you to figure out your eligibility, if the following conditions hold:

- You are uninsured and not receiving Medicare.
- You have a low monthly income.
- You live in California.
- You have not used the “Hospital Presumptive Eligibility” program more than once in the past 12 months (more than twice for children).

U.S. Citizenship is not required.
All four emergency rooms participate in the “Hospital Presumptive Eligibility” program.

### <a id="urgent-care">Urgent Care Options</a>

Visit an urgent care center when you have a medical problem that needs prompt attention but is not life-threatening.
Urgent care centers treat conditions that are too serious to wait for a doctor’s appointment but that do not require emergency room services.
The wait is usually shorter than emergency rooms, and the cost is typically lower for non-emergency conditions.
Most urgent care centers accept walk-ins, and some also allow appointments.
Bring your insurance card, identification, and a list of medications you take.

### <a id="poison-oak">Poison Oak</a>

Poison oak is a common plant in SLO County and grows everywhere from shaded wet creek beds to dry sunny hillsides.
It is a shrub or vine and sometimes also climbs trees and so can appear to be tree branches.
Its leaves appear in groups of three, but they can have a variety of shapes and colors (dark to pale green, pale orange, bright red).
The plants sometimes also display clusters of small green, pale, or red berries.

<div class="poison-oak-images">

![poison oak: flat green leaves with simple borders](/poison-oak-1.png)
![poison oak: flat red leaves with undulating borders](/poison-oak-2.png)
![poison oak: glossy red and green leaves](/poison-oak-3.png)

</div>

The plant exudes an oil that causes a skin rash in people who touch it.
You do not have to touch the plant to be affected: you just need to touch the oil, which can rub off onto clothing, pet fur, or other items.
If you have been near a fire in which poison oak plants were burned, you may be exposed to the oil through the smoke.
You can prevent the rash by washing your skin thoroughly soon after exposure and by washing any clothing or other items that may be carrying the oil.
Rubbing alcohol or detergent soaps can be helpful in removing oils.

The rash appears several hours or even a few days after exposure.
It is typically very itchy, and sometimes blisters.
You can treat the rash with over-the-counter steroid (such as hydrocortisone) creams, or calamine lotion.

If you have trouble breathing or swallowing, you may have inhaled some oils (for example from smoke) and you may be experiencing internal swelling.
In such a case you should seek medical attention.

### <a id="sunburn">Sunburn</a>

Sunburn is painful.
It also can make you fatigued and more susceptible to infection.
In the long run it can put you at higher risk of developing skin cancer.

Homeless people are more prone to sunburn because they have fewer options to escape the mid-day sun.
You can reduce your risk of sunburn by finding shady places to rest during the day, by wearing more thoroughly-covering clothing like long-sleeved shirts and broad-brimmed hats, and by applying sunscreen.
Ask homeless service providers if they have any sunscreen they can give you. Sometimes they do.

> See the [Clothing](#clothing) section of this guide for some tips on where to find free or low-cost clothing.

If you develop a sunburn, you can get some relief with over-the-counter salves and creams, or just by keeping the area moist (perhaps with a dampened cloth).
If you have blisters that break, keep the area clean and covered with a bandage.
If you notice increasing redness that spreads beyond the area of the burn, or pus, or if you develop a fever, seek medical care as this may indicate an infection.

## <a id="tattoo-removal">Tattoo Removal</a>

There are programs available that will erase your tattoos.
This can help you if you have tattoos that interfere with your ability to get a job or that are suggestive of gang or hate group affiliation.
Tattoo removal can help you get a fresh start, unburdened by regretful decisions from your past.

The process of laser tattoo removal takes time.
Typically you undergo between five and twelve visits, each one lasting about five minutes, over several months.
In each visit a laser breaks down ink particles in your tattoo so that your immune system can remove them.
The tattooed area will become red and swollen soon after treatment, but this eventually settles down.
Sometimes there is some blistering and scabbing.
You will need to take some care to keep the area of the tattoo clean, and to apply some ointments that assist healing.

The [**Liberty Tattoo Removal Program**](Directory.md#Liberty-Tattoo-Removal-Program) offers laser tattoo removal of gang-related, anti-social, or economically limiting tattoos.
You are required to do some hours of community service (or an equivalent financial donation) before each treatment, but there is otherwise no cost.
You must agree to remain clean and sober, and to get no more tattoos, during the treatment.
This service is offered to people in SLO County and the treatments take place in SLO city.

[**Catholic Charities**](Directory.md#Catholic-Charities) has a low-cost tattoo removal program ($20–90 per session, on a sliding scale based on ability to pay).
You must also complete 20 hours of community service before beginning treatment.
They prioritize the removal of offensive or gang-related tattoos, and will remove both visible-and-obvious tattoos (e.g. the face, the back of the hands) and more discreet ones.
Call them to begin the process.

The [Removery INK-nitiative Program](https://removery.com/services/ink-nitiative) offers free removal of tattoos, if those tattoos are in visible areas (face, hands, arms) or suggest gang or hate group affiliation, to people who have been incarcerated, are former gang members, or are survivors of domestic abuse or human trafficking.
Apply on their website.

The [Jails to Jobs](https://jailstojobs.org/resources/tattoo-removal-programs) website lists hundreds of other free or low-cost tattoo removal programs throughout the country.

## <a id="end-of-life-help">End-of-Life Care, Advance Directives, Hospice</a>

**In this section:**

- [Hospice and Palliative Care Services](#hospice-and-palliative-care)
- [Advance Directives](#advance-directives)

### <a id="hospice-and-palliative-care">Hospice and Palliative Care Services</a>

Palliative care is medical treatment that aims to relieve pain and suffering, perhaps alongside medical treatment that hopes to cure or treat some health problem.

Hospice care is meant to make the process of dying less uncomfortable, and is meant for people who do not have realistic hopes of being cured and living long.
Typically this means they are in their last six months of life.

[**Hospice SLO**](Directory.md#Hospice-SLO) includes non-medical volunteer support, grief counseling, support groups, in-home respite care, care management, and end-of-life companion support.
All services are provided at no charge (they rely entirely on community donations).
These services are open to San Luis Obispo County residents grieving a death, coping with life-limiting illness, or facing end of life.

The [**Medically Fragile Homeless Program**](Directory.md#Medically-Fragile-Homeless-Program) provides shelter to terminally ill people who have need of housing so that they can die in the dignity and stability of housing with the care of hospice.

[**Aevum Home Health**](Directory.md#Aevum) offers palliative care, and accepts Medicare and Medi-Cal. They also have a hospice program.<!-- unclear if the hospice program also accepts Medicare and Medi-Cal -->

[**Central Coast Home Health and Hospice**](Directory.md#Central-Coast-Home-Health) includes hospice nurse availability, nursing services, spiritual care, dietitian services, social work services, bereavement services, home health aides, trained volunteers, support groups, and musicians.
They accept Medicare; contact them directly to ask about whether Medi-Cal will cover their services.

[**Dignity Health French Hospital Medical Center Home Health and Hospice**](Directory.md#French-Hospital-Medical-Center) includes team-oriented medical care, symptom and pain management, and emotional and spiritual support tailored to patient needs.
They accept Medicare and Medi-Cal.
They also have financial assistance programs that make hospice treatment free for people below 250% of the federal poverty level, and discounted for people below 400% of the federal poverty level (call [888-488-7667](tel:+1-888-488-7667) or [805-542-6321](tel:+1-805-542-6321) for details).

[**Dignity Health**](Directory.md#Dignity-Health) also has a Home Health and Hospice program in Atascadero that includes skilled nursing, hospice care, and palliative care.
They accept Medicare and Medi-Cal.
They also have financial assistance programs that make hospice treatment free for people below 250% of the federal poverty level, and discounted for people below 400% of the federal poverty level (call [888-488-7667](tel:+1-888-488-7667) or [805-542-6321](tel:+1-805-542-6321) for details).
They are located at <a href="#" class="map-link" data-lat="35.497588" data-lon="-120.680838" data-zoom="17" data-label="Home Health and Hospice">4555 El Camino Real #A</a>, are open M–F 8am–5pm, and can be reached by phone at [805-434-1427](tel:+1-805-434-1427) or [800-549-9609](tel:+1-800-549-9609).

[**Medi-Cal**](Directory.md#Medi-Cal) ([**CenCal**](Directory.md#CenCal)) recipients who have a life expectancy of six months or less can choose to receive Medi-Cal covered hospice care in lieu of ordinary medical coverage.
Medi-Cal (CenCal) also covers palliative care as part of its ordinary medical coverage.

Hospice care is part of the Veterans Health Administration (VHA)’s standard medical benefits package.
If you are a veteran who is enrolled with the VHA, and you have a clinical need for end-of-life hospice care, you can get this without a copay through the VHA.
Contact the local [**Veterans Administration Outpatient Clinic**](Directory.md#Veterans-Administration-Outpatient-Clinic) or call the national department of Veterans Affairs at [800-827-1000](tel:+1-800-827-1000).

### <a id="advance-directives">Advance Directives</a>

<!-- To-do: This section needs review from a professional who knows about this stuff, specifically as it applies in California -->

Advance Health Care Directives are legal documents that let you communicate your health care wishes in advance, in case you become unable to speak for yourself.
Sometimes people call these “Living Wills.”
These documents include:

- **Advance Health Care Directives:** Specifies which medical treatments you would or would not want if you become terminally ill or are in a persistent vegetative state
- **Healthcare Power of Attorney:** Designates a trusted person to make medical decisions for you when you cannot
- **Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment:** You can use this to tell physicians how much they should intervene to try to extend your life
- **Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) Orders:** Expresses your desire to refuse resuscitation efforts in particular
- **Organ Donation Authorization:** You give or withhold permission for your organs, tissues, or body parts to be donated when you die, or put conditions on how they can be used

These documents help to ensure that your healthcare wishes are respected even if you are incapacitated and cannot express them yourself.
They usually must be signed by you *and* by certain witnesses in order to be effective.
It is a good idea to create such documents *before* you need them, as when you need them you will be preoccupied or unable.
Give these documents to your healthcare providers so they know to respect your specific preferences.

The free websites [PREPARE for Your Care](https://prepareforyourcare.org/) and [The Conversation Project](https://theconversationproject.org/) can help you create advance directive documents that match your needs and your preferences.
The [California Advance Directive Form](https://eforms.com/power-of-attorney/ca/california-advanced-health-care-directive/) website has several varieties of advance directive forms in PDF format that you can review or print.

[**Senior Legal Services Project**](Directory.md#Senior-Legal-Services-Project), [**California Rural Legal Assistance (CRLA)**](Directory.md#California-Rural-Legal-Assistance), and [**SLO Legal Assistance Foundation (SLOLAF)**](Directory.md#SLO-Legal-Assistance-Foundation) can give you free help to make your advance directive documents clear and legally binding.

[**Hospice SLO**](Directory.md#Hospice-SLO) offers advanced directive assistance either in-person at its offices, or by phone or internet conferencing.

Your healthcare provider or hospice can help you fill out a Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment (POLST) form.
It instructs medical care providers whether they should try to extend your life however they can, or whether they should avoid certain types of burdensome treatments like CPR, feeding tubes, or a mechanical breathing apparatus.
A POLST form only works if you or your legally-recognized decision-maker signs it *and* your physician, nurse practitioner, or physician assistant also signs it.
You can change your mind after you fill out such a form and can change it or discontinue it.
You can learn more about the form and review one online, in several languages, at [capolst.org](https://capolst.org/).

### <a id="personal-safety-tips">Personal Safety Tips</a>

To stay safe on the streets, stay aware of your surroundings.
Be alert when you walk alone, and avoid distractions like phones or headphones.
Trust your instincts—if a situation feels unsafe, go somewhere safer.
Walk with confidence: keep your chin up, eyes forward, and maintain a steady pace.
These simple behaviors can make you less vulnerable to potential threats.

Learning to identify trustworthy people is one of the most important street skills you can develop, though it takes time and experience.
Be cautious when forming new relationships—sometimes people experiencing homelessness are victimized by people who say they want to help.
Watch for “red flags” like people who try to exploit your vulnerabilities, who offer deals that seem too good to be true, or who pressure you into uncomfortable or vulnerable situations.
Connect with peers who understand your situation, as these relationships often provide both safety and emotional support.
Remember that developing good judgment about people is a gradual process, not something you can master immediately.

Whenever possible, travel with trusted companions rather than going places alone.
Having someone you trust with you provides both practical safety and moral support.
Build a network of friends who look out for each other.
Such connections improve your physical safety and also your overall well-being and security.

If you use emergency shelters, address your security concerns with the staff before you settle in.
(For example, if you see someone at the shelter who has been threatening to you in the past, or if you are not sure your possessions will be secure where you have been told to leave them.)
Some people choose to sleep on the streets rather than in shelters because of safety concerns.
If you do stay outside, you need to balance the risks of harassment in public places against the risk of assault in more secluded areas.
Stay vigilant even in places that are supposed to be safe.

If you find yourself in a dangerous situation, your primary goal should be to escape and get help rather than to fight.
The best approach to self-defense is to avoid physical violence through awareness and de-escalation.
If you do need to defend yourself, learn a few simple techniques that can make an attacker reconsider and give you time to get away.
When possible, take formal self-defense classes to learn proper techniques from trained instructors.

## <a id="ids-and-other-documents">IDs and Other Documents</a> (How to Obtain, Replace, Secure)

Often, agencies and programs will ask you to produce certain documents, like a government identification card (such as a driver’s license), a social security card, a birth certificate, and so forth.
If you have lost such documents, or have never obtained them, this can be an obstacle to working with those agencies and programs.

This section of the guide shows you how to obtain or replace documents like these.

**In this section:**

- [Social Security Numbers or Cards](#social-security-numbers-or-cards)
- [ID Cards and Driver’s Licenses](#id-cards-drivers-licenses)
- [Birth, Death, and Marriage Certificates](#birth-death-marriage-certificates)
- [Civil Case Documents](#civil-case-documents)
- [Passports](#passports)
- [Tips](#document-tips)

### <a id="social-security-numbers-or-cards">Social Security Numbers or Cards</a>

You do not often need your social security card, but you do often need your social security number.
The [**Social Security Administration**](Directory.md#Social-Security-Administration) can help you get a new Social Security card.

If you have an account or are able to create an on-line account at [ssa.gov/myaccount](https://www.ssa.gov/myaccount), you can request a Social Security card on-line and it will be mailed to you.
You can get help with this process by calling [800-772-1213](tel:+1-800-772-1213) (TTY: [800-325-0778](tel:+1-800-325-0778)).

> See [Mail Drops, Post Office Boxes, Etc.](#mail-drops-post-office-boxes) for ways to get mail if you do not have a stable mailing address.

If you are unable to complete this on-line process, you can visit the local Social Security Administration office to get a new card.
It will go more smoothly if you can bring some alternative form of identification like a driver’s license or passport.
In the absence of those, a military ID, employee ID, school ID, or health insurance card might be helpful.

### <a id="id-cards-drivers-licenses">ID Cards and Driver’s Licenses</a>

A state-issued “Real ID,” or a California driver’s license which is also a Real ID, is a useful form of government-issued photo identification card that is widely accepted by a variety of programs, businesses, and service providers.
You get such an identification card from the [**California DMV**](Directory.md#California-DMV).
You must visit the California DMV office to have your photo taken and to submit your paperwork.

You typically first need to already have another identification document (such as a certified birth certificate, a passport, a permanent resident card, a certificate of naturalization or citizenship, or a permanent resident card) as well as documents that demonstrate your California residency (such as a utility bill, tax return, bank statement, or rental agreement that contains your name and address).
There are also fees you typically must pay to obtain either a Real ID or a driver’s license that operates as a Real ID.

However, if you are homeless, you may be able to get a waiver for fees (a “no-fee ID card”), and you may be able to use the address of a homeless shelter or other homeless services agency as your California residency address.
This is true even if you are only temporarily homeless because you are fleeing domestic violence or a similar dangerous situation.
You can only get a simple Real ID (“California Identification Card”) with the no-fee method, not a driver’s license.
Homeless services providers like [**40 Prado Homeless Services Center**](Directory.md#40-Prado), the [**5Cities Homeless Coalition (5CHC)**](Directory.md#5CHC), or the [**El Camino Homeless Organization (ECHO)**](Directory.md#ECHO) can help you with this process.

If you have previously received a Real ID or California driver’s license, but you have lost the card and need to replace it, you can begin this process by visiting [www.edl.dmv.ca.gov/apply](https://www.dmv.ca.gov/wasapp/oddl/oddlApplication.do) or the California DMV office.

### <a id="birth-death-marriage-certificates">Birth, Death, and Marriage Certificates</a>

If you were born in SLO County, you can obtain a copy of your birth certificate from the [**SLO County Clerk-Recorder**](Directory.md#SLO-County-Clerk-Recorder).
You will need to show valid identification (typically, a government-issued photo ID like a driver’s license or passport).

There is also a $32 fee.
However, if you are homeless, you can request an “Affidavit of Homeless Status for Fee Exempt Certified Copy of Birth Certificate.”
You need to sign this and you also need to get a signature from a “homeless services provider.”
This exempts you from having to pay the $32 fee.
Homeless services providers like [**40 Prado Homeless Services Center**](Directory.md#40-Prado), the [**5Cities Homeless Coalition (5CHC)**](Directory.md#5CHC), or the [**El Camino Homeless Organization (ECHO)**](Directory.md#ECHO) can help you with this process.

You can obtain a “certified copy” of a birth certificate for yourself or your child or other close relative.
A certified copy allows you to establish your identity.
Otherwise you can obtain an “informational” copy, which is not valid for establishing identity.
You should understand ahead of time whether or not you need a certified copy, and, if so, you should be sure to ask for one specifically when you order your copy.

You can also use the [VitalChek](https://www.vitalchek.com/v/vital-records/california/san-luis-obispo-county-recorder) website to order an *informational* copy of your birth certificate on-line without visiting the SLO County Clerk-Recorder office.
(You may need to provide a notarized, sworn statement if you want to order a “certified copy” this way, in which case it is probably just as easy to visit the SLO County Clerk-Recorder office.)
That may cost a bit more.

Death records for deaths that occurred in SLO County can also be obtained from the SLO County Clerk-Recorder ($24) or from VitalChek.
Again, there is a difference between “certified” and “informational” copies of death certificates, and you should check which one you need before you order it.
You can typically only get a “certified” copy for a close relative, and you may have to provide additional documentation.

You can also get a copy of a marriage certificate that was issued in SLO County from the SLO County Clerk-Recorder office ($17) or from VitalChek.
Again, there is a difference between “certified” and “informational” copies, and you should check which one you need before you order it.
You can typically only get a “certified” copy for yourself or a close relative, and you may have to provide additional documentation.

There is no homeless fee exemption program for death and marriage certificates the way there is for birth certificates.

If you need a birth, death, or marriage certificate from another county in California, try the [California Department of Public Health’s “Vital Records”](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CHSI/Pages/Vital-Records.aspx) web page.
If you need such records from elsewhere in the U.S. outside California, visit the [National Center for Health Statistics](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/w2w/index.htm) web page.
The VitalChek website can often also get you these records from other areas.

### <a id="civil-case-documents">Civil Case Documents</a>

To get copies of [SLO Superior Court](Directory.md#SLO-Superior-Court) documents in civil cases to which you are a party, first go to the court offices in San Luis Obispo or in Paso Robles.
Those offices have a publicly-accessible computer at which you can find your case number.
Court staff can help you with this process.
Then review the documents associated with that case, choose which documents you want, and request them.
You must pay 50¢ per page to get printouts of these documents.

If you cannot go to the court offices, you can follow the procedure described on [this web page](https://www.slo.courts.ca.gov/self-help/civil-appeals/getting-copies-court-files) to order documents by mail.

If you have a lawyer, that lawyer may be able to search for these documents on-line themselves.

> See the [Legal Help & Crime Victim Protection](#legal-help) section for some tips on getting help from a lawyer.

### <a id="passports">Passports</a>

A U.S. passport is required for international travel to most countries outside the United States.
You need a passport to travel by air, land, or sea to most international destinations.

#### <a id="first-time-passport">Getting a Passport for the First Time</a>

To apply for your first U.S. passport, you must apply in person at an authorized passport acceptance facility.
You cannot apply by mail for a first-time passport.
It costs $165 total ($130 application fee + $35 execution fee) to apply for an adult passport.
You must bring the following documents:

1. Proof of U.S. citizenship (Certified U.S. birth certificate with official seal, or Certificate of Naturalization, or Certificate of Citizenship, or Consular Report of Birth Abroad, or a previous U.S. passport)
   - Note: Digital or mobile birth certificates are not accepted; you must bring a physical birth certificate
2. A photo identification with your picture (driver’s license, government employee ID, U.S. military ID, or Certificate of Naturalization or Citizenship)
   - Note: Digital or photocopied documents are not accepted; you must bring the original document
   - You must also submit photocopies of the front and back of your ID
3. A recent passport photo that meets official requirements
4. A completed Form DS-11 (do not it sign until you are instructed to do so by the passport agent)

You also must provide an address where you can receive your passport by mail.
If you do not have a stable address, consider using a mail drop service (see the [Mail drops section](#mail-drops-post-office-boxes) of this guide).

You can apply for a passport at the post office.

If you are applying for a new passport, if your passport expired more than five years ago and you need a new one, or if your passport was lost or damaged and you need a new one, you can also apply for a passport at certain [**SLO County Public Libraries**](Directory.md#SLO-County-Public-Libraries) branches. <!-- Note: the U.S. State Dept. lists these as Atascadero, Nipomo, and SLO; the SLO County Library website lists these as Arroyo Grande, Atascadero, and SLO -->
Call them to make an appointment:

- [**Atascadero Library**](Directory.md#SLO-County-Public-Libraries)
- [**Nipomo Library**](Directory.md#SLO-County-Public-Libraries)
- [**SLO City Library**](Directory.md#SLO-County-Public-Libraries)

#### Renewing Your Passport

You can renew your passport by mail if all of the following are true:

- You have your most recent passport with you
- Your passport is not damaged or mutilated
- Your passport was issued when you were age 16 or older
- Your passport was issued within the last 15 years
- Your passport is in your current name (or you can document a legal name change)

If you meet these requirements, you can renew by mail using Form DS-82.
This costs $130 for adults.
You can also renew online at [travel.state.gov](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/have-passport/renew-online.html) if you meet additional eligibility requirements.

If you cannot renew by mail (for example, if your passport is lost, stolen, damaged, or expired more than five years), you must apply in person using the same process as for a first-time passport.

#### Replacing a Lost or Stolen Passport

If your passport is lost or stolen, follow these steps to get a new one:

1. **Report it immediately:**
  Report your passport lost or stolen as soon as possible.
  This protects you from identity theft.
  You can report [online using Form DS-64](https://pptform.state.gov/), by calling [877-487-2778](tel:+1-877-487-2778) (TTY [888-874-7793](tel:+1-888-874-7793)), or in person when you apply for a replacement.
  Note that if you report your passport lost or stolen, you can no longer use it for travel even if you find it later.

1. **Apply for a replacement:**
  To replace a lost or stolen passport, apply in person at an authorized passport acceptance facility.
  The process and requirements are the same as for a first-time passport application ([see above](#first-time-passport)).
  Reporting your passport lost or stolen does not replace it; to get a replacement you must also apply for a new passport.
  This costs $165.

#### Passports from Other Countries

If you are a citizen of another country and you need to obtain or renew a passport from your home country, contact your country’s embassy or consulate.
The nearest consulates for many countries are located in Los Angeles or San Francisco.
You can find contact information for embassies and consulates at [embassy.goabroad.com](https://embassy.goabroad.com/) or by searching online for your country’s embassy or consulate in the United States.

### <a id="document-tips">Tips</a>

#### Document Storage and Security

Here are some tips for handling important documents:

- Use your phone camera to take photos of important documents, and save those photos “in the cloud” (iCloud for iPhone, Google Photos for Android) so still have access to your photos if your phone is lost or stolen.
- Make copies of important documents, and store the copies separately from the originals.
  That way if you lose one set, you are less likely to lose all of them.
- Some homeless services centers offer document storage for their clients.
  Ask your case worker if they are able to store your important documents in your file at those agencies.
- If you have enough money, consider storing especially important or difficult-to-replace documents in a safety deposit box at a bank.
  These can be rented for $30–50 per year.

#### If You Have No Identification Documents

If you are completely without identifying documentation, you may need help establishing your identity so that you can access programs and services that require identifying documentation.

You may want to begin by contacting the [**Social Security Administration**](Directory.md#Social-Security-Administration) who can assist you in verifying your identity through their records.

[**SLO Court Self-Help Services**](Directory.md#SLO-Court-Self-Help-Services) can help you through California’s affidavit processes, with which you can establish your identity when you lack identity documentation.
This way you can get a California photo ID card, which helps you get access to many programs and services.
There is an expensive filing fee for this process, but ask about a fee waiver that is available to people with low incomes.

If you have a case manager, ask them if they can help you with this process.

## <a id="mail-drops-post-office-boxes">Mail Drops, Post Office Boxes, Etc.</a>

If you are homeless, you may be at a loss when asked for your mailing address.
There are various ways to establish a reliable mailing address even if you do not have a stable living address.

The [**5Cities Homeless Coalition**](Directory.md#5CHC) and [**40 Prado Homeless Services Center**](Directory.md#40-Prado) offices permit clients of their services to use these offices as mailing addresses, and will hold your incoming mail there for you. <!-- Source (5CHC) https://5chc.org/programs/information-and-referral-coordinated-entry -->
Ask them for details.

<!-- To-do: NEEDS VERIFICATION
 North County Mail Drop Services (*needs verification*): For people in North County areas (Paso Robles, Atascadero, Templeton), contact [**El Camino Homeless Organization (ECHO)**](Directory.md#ECHO) at [805-462-3663](tel:+1-805-462-3663) to inquire about mail drop services at their Paso Robles (1134 Black Oak Dr.) or Atascadero (7600 El Camino Real #12) locations. Additionally, [**Transitions Mental Health Association (TMHA)**](Directory.md#TMHA) has locations in Arroyo Grande (203 Bridge St.) that may offer mail services for clients; call [805-540-6500](tel:+1-805-540-6500) to inquire. These organizations may allow clients to use their addresses for receiving mail.

You can rent mail boxes from UPS Stores and from the U.S. Postal Service.
The Postal Service option is the most affordable of the two.
But sometimes, a “P.O. Box” address (which is what you get from the Postal Service) is not adequate for your needs, and one advantage of the UPS Store option is that it appears as a regular street address (e.g. “1241 Johnson Avenue #1234, San Luis Obispo").
UPS Store locations with mailbox rental services are available throughout SLO County including:

**Note**: In cities with multiple post office locations, General Delivery is typically handled at only one facility (usually the main post office). For example, San Luis Obispo has two post offices, but General Delivery is handled at the main location on Dalidio Dr.
To confirm which location handles General Delivery in your area, call [800-275-8777](tel:+1-800-275-8777) and request “Customer Service,” or use the [USPS ZIP Code lookup tool](https://tools.usps.com/zip-code-lookup.htm) by entering “General Delivery” as the address line.
<!-- Source: [faq.usps.com](https://faq.usps.com/s/article/What-is-General-Delivery) -->

You should speak with the postmaster at the post office where you want to receive general delivery mail beforehand.
The post office will hold general delivery mail for you for 30 days.
You must have a valid photo ID to pick up your mail at the post office.
This service is free.
However, this is not a long-term solution; it is meant for temporary use (for instance by travelers passing through town).
The post office may stop accepting general delivery mail for you if you try to use this method for a long time or if you get too much mail.

<!-- Other options to investigate:
   1. **Faith-Based and Community Mail Services**
      - Specific Organizations to Contact:

- [Debt Consolidation](#debt-consolidation)

### <a id="banks-and-credit-unions">Banks and Credit Unions</a>

Credit unions are like banks, but are nonprofit organizations that tend to be locally-focused.
They can often be more accommodating than banks to people with low incomes and to homeless people.

Credit unions in SLO County include:

- [**CoastHills Credit Union**](Directory.md#CoastHills-Credit-Union)
- [**Golden 1 Credit Union**](Directory.md#Golden-1-Credit-Union)
- [**SESLOC Credit Union**](Directory.md#SESLOC-Credit-Union)
- [**SLO Credit Union**](Directory.md#SLO-Credit-Union)

Some ordinary banks offer “Bank On Certified Accounts” which are savings or checking accounts that are more affordable, have small minimum balances, and have no overdraft fees.
You can search for banks that offer such accounts at [joinbankon.org](https://joinbankon.org/accounts/).

> See the [Mail Drops, Post Office Boxes, Etc.](#mail-drops-post-office-boxes) section of this guide if you do not have a stable address and you need an address you can use while establishing a bank account.

> See the [IDs and other documents](#ids-and-other-documents) section of this guide for information on how to obtain required identification and other documentation.

**Tips for how to succeed in establishing a bank account:**

- Call ahead: Contact banks before you visit and ask about their specific requirements
- Bring multiple documents: Have as much identification and address verification as possible
- Ask about special programs: Specifically inquire about programs for people without permanent addresses
- Consider credit unions first: They are often more flexible and community-focused than large banks

## <a id="tax-preparation">Tax Preparation</a>

There are several programs that can give you free assistance in filling out and filing your annual tax returns.
Free tax assistance programs are usually available in the February-through-April period.

Even if you do not think you owe any taxes because your income is very low, it can be to your advantage to file a tax return.
This is for a few reasons:

1. You may qualify for certain refundable tax credits that can put money in your pocket, even if you did not pay taxes all year.
1. Some programs for low-income people require those people to show their most recent tax return to prove that they qualify.
1. Filing a tax return, even if it is of no practical effect, can be a gesture of compliance with the law that can be helpful, for example if you are engaged in the U.S. immigration process.

Avoid using commercial tax preparers that charge high fees, or that offer “refund anticipation loans.”
Some of these give poor-quality tax advice, and most of them are bad bargains compared to the free services.

If you are due a tax refund, you will get that refund more quickly if you have a bank account that accepts direct deposit.
The U.S. Internal Revenue Service stopped issuing paper tax refund checks in 2025.

> See the [Banking and Money Management](#banking-and-money-management) section of this guide for help in establishing a bank account.

The national Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) program allows low- and moderate-income people to get free help in preparing and filing their federal and state tax returns.
[**United Way of SLO County**](Directory.md#United-Way) coordinates the local VITA program through various partner organizations, including Cal Poly and [**AARP**](Directory.md#AARP-Tax-Aide).
The AARP Tax-Aide Program is especially for people over age 50.
Use United Way’s [211](tel:+1-211) service to find a VITA location near you and make an appointment.
The United Way also has [an on-line program](https://www.myfreetaxes.org/file-with-virtual-help/) with which you can upload your tax documents and get free help from tax preparation volunteers over the internet.

There are also free options that allow you to file your federal income taxes yourself by using guided tax preparation software or by filling in on-line forms and filing them electronically.
See [irs.gov/freefile](https://www.irs.gov/freefile) for details.
<!-- Note: IRS “Direct File” is kaput as of tax year 2025 -->

> See the [Internet Access / Email / Digital Access Assistance](#internet-and-email) section of this guide for ways to get access to a computer and the internet.

Homeless people can use the address of a friend, relative, or trusted service provider as their filing address.

## <a id="navigating-social-security">Navigating Social Security / SSDI / SSI / Survivors Benefits / CAPI</a>

> See the [Social Security Numbers or Cards](#social-security-numbers-or-cards) section of this guide to learn how to get a Social Security number or to get or replace a Social Security card.

Note: in 2025, Social Security stopped issuing paper checks.
Now they use direct deposit to bank accounts or issue a “Direct Express” prepaid debit card.

> See the [Banks and Credit Unions](#banks-and-credit-unions) section of this guide for information on how to establish a bank account.

There are a number of programs operated by the Social Security Administration, including:

- **Social Security** — monthly payments from the government to people who have reached retirement age, and who paid into the social security system while they were working
- **Social Security Disability Insurance** (SSDI) — monthly payments from the government to people who cannot work because they are disabled, and who paid into the social security system while they were working
- **Supplemental Security Income** (SSI) — monthly payments from the government to disabled people and to seniors who have limited means

Homeless people have the same rights as anyone else to apply for these payments.
You do not have to have a permanent address to receive benefits.

You may be entitled to certain benefits even if you did not pay into the social security system, if your spouse or ex-spouse did.
You may need to appear at the Social Security Administration office in person to apply for such spousal or survivors benefits.

> See the [Mail drops](#mail-drops-post-office-boxes) section of this guide for information on establishing a mailing address.

You can apply for these benefits through the local [**Social Security Administration**](Directory.md#Social-Security-Administration) office either in person or by phone.
You can also [apply on-line](https://www.ssa.gov/apply) at the Social Security Administration’s website.
If you have a case worker, ask them if they can help you through the process or refer you to someone who can.

To make the application process go smoothly, find out what documentation you need and have that documentation with you when you apply.
If you do not have a stable mailing address, establish one ahead of time.
If you are applying for disability, bring your relevant medical records, treatment history, and medical provider contact information.
Pay stubs and tax records can help to establish your work history, especially if you were paid under-the-table or as a contractor rather than an employee.

Be patient, as the process of applying for benefits can be time-consuming and the bureaucracy can move slowly.
If you are denied benefits, find out about the appeals process and consider appealing the decision.

If you are denied SSI benefits solely because of your immigration status, you may be able to get benefits instead from the [California Assistance Program for Immigrants (CAPI)](https://www.slocounty.ca.gov/departments/social-services/cash-assistance-programs/services/california-assistance-program-for-immigrants-%28capi%29).
Apply from the [**SLO County Department of Social Services**](Directory.md#SLO-County-Department-of-Social-Services).

If you have a disability and are applying for Social Security Disability Insurance, you may be able to get some immediate financial help from the [**SLO County Department of Social Services**](Directory.md#SLO-County-Department-of-Social-Services)’ “General Assistance Disabled Program” while you wait for your application to be processed.
They may also be able to assign you a “Benefits Arch Advocate” who can help you apply for SSI and SSDI.

#### Educational Continuity (McKinney-Vento Act)

Federal law (the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act) protects homeless students in elementary through high school in several ways:

1. You have the right to enroll in school even if you currently lack documents such as proof of residency, immunization records, or birth certificates.
1. You have the right to attend the same school you were enrolled in when you were last housed, even if you have since lost your home.
1. You have the right to transportation to and from school.
1. You have the right to the same educational services as non-homeless students.
1. If you are an unaccompanied homeless youth, you have the right to enroll in school without the consent of your parent or guardian.

Homelessness, as the McKinney-Vento Act defines it, also includes situations when you are living at someone else’s house, living in a motel or campground, living in a vehicle, living in a shelter, or squatting in an abandoned building.

Every school district has a McKinney-Vento liaison whom you can go to if you need help defending these rights.
You can find [a list of these liaisons and their contact information](https://www.slocoe.org/about/programs/homeless-and-foster-youth-services-coordinating-program/school-district-liaisons-and-contacts/) at the SLO County Office of Education website.

The SLO County Office of Education’s [“Homeless and Foster Youth Services Coordinating Program”](https://www.slocoe.org/about/programs/homeless-and-foster-youth-services-coordinating-program/) can help homeless and foster youth manage their enrollment in school, including choosing which school to attend, getting their records transferred from previous schools, and finding resources that will be useful to them.
To access this program, contact the McKinney-Vento liaison for your school district or contact the County Office of Education at [805-782-7268](+1-805-782-7268) or [jthomas@slocoe.org](mailto:jthomas@slocoe.org).

I'm confused about what SAFE is. Is it a variety of Family Resource Center? Are "Family Resource Centers" a standardized program that offer a standard set of things, or are they just a common name that's adopted by a variety of programs? Are these things that people self-refer to, or do they kind of get assigned to them by social workers and such? Online sources of information are vague on these points.

## <a id="disaster-preparedness">Disaster Planning/Preparation</a>

Fires, floods, and earthquakes sometimes strike SLO County.
Extremes of weather like heat waves, freezing temperatures, and storms are also increasingly common.
Epidemics, tsunamis, and hazardous materials releases can also happen.
If you are homeless and sleeping outdoors, you can be especially vulnerable to such dangers.

The [**SLO County Office of Emergency Services**](Directory.md#SLO-County-Office-of-Emergency-Services) has resources that can help you prepare for and respond to emergency situations.
Their [ReadySLO.org](https://readyslo.org/) site includes the following sections:

1. [PrepareSLO.org](https://www.prepareslo.org/)—how to prepare for the next emergency, how to learn your evacuation zone number, and how to understand emergency alerts
1. [EmergencySLO.org](https://www.emergencyslo.org/)—information about ongoing emergencies, evacuation orders and warnings, evacuation shelters, and road closures
1. [RecoverSLO.org](https://www.recoverslo.org/)—after an emergency, this page lists some ways to recover from it

You can sign up for local emergency alerts by text message to your phone at [AlertSLO](https://public.alertsense.com/SignUp/?RegionId=1317).
You can choose which sorts of alerts you are interested in receiving (for example “Flood / Flash Flood” and “Fire”).

The [**Red Cross**](Directory.md#Red-Cross) operates emergency shelters during major disasters.
They usually have pet-friendly options.

### <a id="fire-safety">Fire Safety in Camp</a>

If you are camping outdoors, be very careful with fire.
California frequently experiences major wildfires, and campfires are a frequent cause.

Build fires at least 25 feet away from tents, shrubs, and flammable materials.
Do not build fires under overhanging tree branches.
Avoid fires on windy days and during periods when fire danger is particularly high (such as mid to late Summer).
Do not use flammable liquids like gasoline or lighter fluid to start camp fires.

Keep fires small.
It is wiser and takes less effort to make a small fire and sit close to it than to make a big fire and sit far away.

Use existing fire rings when these are available.
Otherwise clear a five-foot (two-meter) radius around the fire of all vegetation and flammable material.

Have a bucket of water handy.

Do not leave a fire unattended.
Always extinguish it thoroughly first.
To extinguish a fire thoroughly, soak it with water.
Stir the ashes to expose any unburned material, and soak it again.
The fire is not thoroughly extinguished until you can place your hand anywhere into the ashes without getting burned.

Note that in SLO County it is not legal to have a campfire outside of a developed campground unless you have a valid [California Campfire Permit](https://www.ca.gov/departments/147/services/1239/).
In many times and places in SLO County it is not legal to make a campfire whether you have such a permit or not.

### <a id="extreme-cold-and-heat">Extreme Cold and Heat</a>

SLO County is in general blessed with a moderate climate, but rainy or dangerously cold overnight weather is common in Winter, and dangerously hot daytime weather is common in Summer.
See the [Warming/Cooling Centers](#warming-cooling-centers) of this guide for some ways to get shelter from these temperature extremes.
Warming centers typically open when temperatures are due to drop to 38°F or below or there is more than a 50% chance of rain.

- [Reporting Crimes](#reporting-crimes)
- [Reporting Government Misconduct](#reporting-misconduct)

San Luis Obispo County is an especially challenging place for people trying to avoid or to escape homelessness.
Nearly one in four homeless people in the United States lives in California.
California has one of the highest per-capita rates of homelessness in the nation, and the highest percentage of unsheltered homeless people.
In San Luis Obispo County, there are only enough shelter beds for about 20–30% of the people known to be homeless here, and so the county has the third highest percentage of *unsheltered* homelessness of any mostly-rural county in the U.S.
The city of San Luis Obispo is one of the top ten most expensive cities in the U.S. based on how much income (relative to the median income) you must have in order to afford to buy a home.
10% of schoolchildren in SLO County are homeless.

Why are things especially difficult here?
There are many reasons, but the most important one is “too few homes for the number of people who need them.”
The reasons why that is a problem are complicated, but include government policies that reduce the availability of homes and make them more expensive, resource constraints, and high demand.

### <a id="influencing-policy">Influencing policy</a>

The [SLO County Homeless Services Division](https://www.slocounty.ca.gov/departments/social-services/homeless-services-division) is in charge of implementing County policies to address homelessness.
These policies include [*The San Luis Obispo Countywide Plan to Address Homelessness, 2022–2027*](https://www.slocounty.ca.gov/departments/social-services/homeless-services-division/homeless-services-oversight-council/forms-documents/2022/slocountywideplantoaddresshomelessness).
You can contact them at [SS_HomelessServices@co.slo.ca.us](mailto:ss_homelessservices@co.slo.ca.us).

The Homeless Services Division is advised and overseen by the [Homeless Services Oversight Council (HSOC)](https://www.slocounty.ca.gov/departments/social-services/homeless-services-division/homeless-services-oversight-council).
This council welcomes people with current or past lived experience of homelessness to join it.
You can apply for a seat on this council by filling out [this form](https://www.slocounty.ca.gov/departments/social-services/homeless-services-division/homeless-services-oversight-council/hsoc-membership/forms-documents/2024/hsoc-membership-application-form) and submitting it to [SS_HomelessServices@co.slo.ca.us](mailto:SS_HomelessServices@co.slo.ca.us).

The meetings of this council and its committees are open to the public, either in person, or via Zoom or phone.
Visit [slocounty.gov/HSOC](https://www.slocounty.ca.gov/departments/social-services/homeless-services-division/homeless-services-oversight-council) for meeting schedules.

Every two years, typically in January, a census of homeless people in the United States is attempted.
This is called the [“Point-in-Time Count”](https://www.slocounty.ca.gov/departments/social-services/homeless-services-division/point-in-time-count).
This helps the government estimate how many people are homeless, where homeless people are, and what their characteristics are.
This in turn helps the government decide what policy responses to prioritize.
You can read [the official report on SLO County’s 2024 Point-in-Time Count](https://www.slocounty.ca.gov/getmedia/3eb220e5-a230-4c31-9a87-e2bc24e648be/2024_pitcount_communityreport).
The Point-in-Time Count is conducted by volunteers.
If you would like to help with the Count, email [HSD_PITCount@co.slo.ca.us](mailto:HSD_PITCount@co.slo.ca.us) for details.

[SLOCo YIMBY](https://www.slocoyimby.org/) is a grassroots group that advocates for building more housing in SLO County, and for policy changes like legalizing multifamily housing, streamlining permitting, increasing affordable housing funding, and strengthening renter protections.
They mobilize citizen action and outreach campaigns in support of those goals.
Contact [hello@slocoyimby.org](mailto:hello@slocoyimby.org) for details.

The [National Coalition for the Homeless](https://nationalhomeless.org/) campaigns on the national level for changes in U.S. federal policy to alleviate homelessness and help people who are homeless.

The [National Union of the Homeless](https://nationalunionofthehomeless.org/) has a [Sacramento chapter](https://sacramentohomelessunion.org/) that helped SLO County homeless people fight for legal protection when the Kansas Avenue (a.k.a. Oklahoma Avenue) safe parking program was closed.

### <a id="reporting-misconduct">Reporting Government Misconduct</a>

You can report misconduct by police or sheriff personnel to the police or sheriff departments.
Some departments welcome such reports and use them to improve or to discipline misbehaving employees.
Other departments are hostile to such complaints and may even retaliate against people who report misconduct.
You may want to carefully consider the pros and cons before filing misconduct complaints.

| Arroyo Grande police | [Citizen Complaint](https://ca-arroyogrande.civicplus.com/464/Citizen-Complaint) |

| others               | call, or visit in person |

### <a id="totally-free-stuff">Totally Free</a>

The [Freecycle San Luis Obispo](https://www.freecycle.org/town/SanLuisObispoCA) network is free to join (you must create an on-line account to participate).
People in the network can announce when they have things that they no longer want and would like to give away, or can request items they are looking for.
All items are cost-free.
There are also “Buy Nothing” groups in the area that have a similar focus.
The [Buy Nothing Project](https://buynothingproject.org/find-a-group) has an app you can use to connect with people nearby who have things to give away.
You may have better luck searching Facebook for “Buy Nothing” plus the name of the town you are in.

“Little Free Libraries” are boxes in public areas (for example adjacent to sidewalks) where people leave books they are giving away.
Anyone is free to take books for their own use from Little Free Libraries.
There is no check-out/check-in procedure. Just take what you want to read, or leave what you’re finished reading.
They are typically open 24-hours a day, every day.
See [**Little Free Libraries**](Directory.md#Little-Free-Libraries) in the Directory for a list of dozens of them in SLO County.

“Little Free Pantries” are similar, but rather than holding books, they specialize in non-perishable food, feminine hygiene products, pet food, and miscellaneous other items.
See [**Little Free Pantries**](Directory.md#Little-Free-Pantries) in the Directory for a list of several in SLO County.

The Shandon branch of [**SLO County Public Libraries**](Directory.md#SLO-County-Public-Libraries) has a tool-lending library.
People with county library cards can borrow power tools like drills, saws, sanders, or a router; outdoor tools like a leaf blower, hedge trimmer, or pole saw; and manual tools like ladders, levels, dollies, or a workbench.
You must complete some extra forms and a liability waiver to use the tool lending library.

PG&E’s [Energy Savings Assistance (ESA) Program](https://www.pge.com/en/save-energy-and-money/energy-saving-programs/energy-savings-assistance-program.html) helps low-income households upgrade or repair water heaters, furnaces, lighting, and appliances for no cost.
This can also improve energy efficiency, which will lower your utility bills.
See their website for information on who is eligible and how to apply, or call [800-933-9555](tel:+1-800-933-9555).

[**CAPSLO**](Directory.md#CAPSLO) can connect low-income households with providers of no-cost weatherization through their [Home and Energy Services](https://capslo.org/energy-services/) program.
They can also connect seniors (aged 60+) with providers of no-cost minor home repairs through that program.
Call their Energy Office for details.

The [**Front Porch**](Directory.md#Front-Porch) cafe on the Cal Poly campus will pour you a free cup of coffee.

> See [Holiday Gifts for Children](#holiday-gifts-for-children) in the [Children, Youth, and People with Children](#children-youth-parents) section of this guide for information on how to get free toys, coats, bicycles, and other such gifts for your children during the holidays.

### <a id="low-cost-stuff">Low-Cost</a>

> See [Clothing: Thrift Stores](#thrift-stores) for a list of low-cost thrift stores in our area. Many sell a variety of goods other than clothing.

[**Habitat for Humanity ReStore**](Directory.md#Habitat-for-Humanity) sells recycled construction materials, building supplies, furniture, appliances, and home décor at low prices.

[SLO MakerSpace](https://www.slomakerspace.com/) can give you access to a variety of tools–everything from basic hand tools to laser cutters and 3D printers.
You can get a free “partner pass” membership through [**SLO County Public Libraries**](Directory.md#SLO-County-Public-Libraries).
This allows you to access some of the tools during some of the operating hours.
To access their full set of tools at all times, you may need to pay for a full membership.
You will also need to attend a general orientation.
Some advanced tools also require that you take tool-specific orientation classes before you can use them, and some of those cost money.
