## Avoiding, Surviving, and Escaping Homelessness in SLO County

This guide helps you find free and low-cost resources that can help you if you are experiencing homelessness, are threatened with homelessness, or are just short on money.
It is specific to San Luis Obispo County.

San Luis Obispo County is especially challenging for people trying to avoid or to escape homelessness.
Fortunately, there is a lot of help available.
Unfortunately, it can be difficult to find this help or to understand how to access it.
This guide makes it easier.

The guide is organized into sections like “Shelter and Housing” or “Food.”
Each section briefly describes resources available in San Luis Obispo County.
Many descriptions contain blue-highlighted, boldface links to the [**Directory**](?section=directory).
This Directory page lists resources in alphabetical order, with information like the website, phone number, email address, location, and operating hours.
If you find a resource in the guide that may be useful to you, click the boldface link to go to the Directory and learn how to access that resource.

Volunteers from [**Shower the People**](Directory.md#Shower-the-People) created this guide.

## <a id="self-advocacy">Standing Up for Yourself and Communicating with Service Providers</a>

When you meet with case managers and service providers, you can make it more likely that they can help you.
This section of the guide gives some tips about how to do this.

### <a id="build-good-relationships">Build Good Relationships with Case Managers and Service Providers</a>

You can get better results by being prepared.
Bring your ID, any paperwork about your situation, and a list of questions or needs.

Be honest and direct when you explain your situation, your needs, and any problems you face.
Ask questions if you need help understanding programs, requirements, or next steps.
When providers help you, tell them you appreciate it.
Good relationships help everyone.

Stay in touch with providers who are especially helpful, even when you’re not actively using their services.

### <a id="manage-appointments">Manage Appointments and Commitments</a>

Set phone alarms or ask for reminder calls when they are available so you do not miss appointments.
Make sure you have a way to travel to appointments (see the [Transportation](#transportation) section).
Bring something to do in case there is a wait, and expect some delays in busy service settings.
If you need to change an appointment, call ahead rather than just not attending.

Arrive early to appointments if you can.
If you will be late, call ahead.
Keep a notebook or use your phone to note appointments, contacts, and any promises people make to you.
If someone promises to do something for you but you don’t hear back in a reasonable time, check back with them.

### <a id="know-your-rights">Know Your Rights</a>

Many service providers have non-discrimination policies and try to treat people with respect, though policies vary between agencies.
Some services have specific rules about who can use them (like veterans-only programs, or programs with income limits).
Privacy policies vary by agency.

Government homeless service providers (and service providers that get government grants and contracts) often share information about their clients through the HMIS (Homeless Management Information System).
Before such a service provider enters information about you into the HMIS, you will receive [a privacy notice](https://www.slocounty.ca.gov/departments/social-services/homeless-services-division/homeless-management-information-system/forms-documents/2025/san-luis-obispo-county-coc-privacy-notice-2024-final) ([español](https://www.slocounty.ca.gov/departments/social-services/homeless-services-division/homeless-management-information-system/forms-documents/2025/san-luis-obispo-coc-hmis-consent-for-release-of-information-2024-final-%28sp%29)) and will be asked for your consent.
You can ask to review this privacy notice at any time. <!-- Source: https://www.slocounty.ca.gov/departments/social-services/homeless-services-division/homeless-management-information-system/forms-documents/2025/san-luis-obispo-county-coc-privacy-notice-2024-final -->
This privacy notice states: “You are still eligible for services if you refuse to have your standard information shared in HMIS.” <!-- Source: https://www.slocounty.ca.gov/departments/social-services/homeless-services-division/homeless-management-information-system/forms-documents/2025/san-luis-obispo-county-coc-privacy-notice-2024-final -->
Ask about HMIS Consent for Release of Information (ROI) forms and what they mean before you sign them.
You have the right to see the information that has been collected about you in the HMIS, to have your own copy of this information, to request changes to it, and to have it marked private (so that it will not be shared with other service providers who use HMIS). <!-- Source: https://www.slocounty.ca.gov/departments/social-services/homeless-services-division/homeless-management-information-system/forms-documents/2025/san-luis-obispo-county-coc-privacy-notice-2024-final -->
The privacy of the information in the HMIS is protected by law, but the government does not always follow the law, so be cautious.

Many programs have procedures for appealing decisions or for filing complaints.
Ask program staff or search online to find the specific process.
Legal aid organizations can help with appeals (see the [Legal assistance](#legal-help) section).

### <a id="document-everything">Document Everything</a>

Keep copies of important documents and applications.
Store documents in waterproof bags.
Use your backpack as a pillow when you sleep.
Keep your most important items in clothes pockets.
If you have enough income, consider getting a safety deposit box for the most important or hard-to-replace documents.

Use your phone to take photos of important paperwork.
Activate automatic cloud backup (iCloud for iPhone, Google Photos for Android) so your photos survive if your phone is lost or stolen.
Phones (iPhones & Androids) typically come with some amount of free cloud storage, so you can keep access to your photos even if you lose your phone.

Keep the dates, names, and outcomes of important conversations.
Keep case numbers, application numbers, and confirmation numbers.

### <a id="focus-on-goals">Focus on Your Goals and Strengths</a>

Tell people clearly what you are working toward (housing, employment, healthcare, etc.).
Share your skills, experience, education, and personal strengths when they matter for the services you want.
For example, tell employment services about your work experience.

Come to meetings with ideas about what might work for your situation.
Follow through on promises you make and take active steps toward your goals.

### <a id="navigate-system-barriers">Navigate System Barriers</a>

Learn the rules for programs: who can use them, when applications are due, and what steps you need to take.
If you don’t qualify for one program, ask about other options.
If you have disabilities or special needs that make it difficult to access a program, ask about help they can provide.

If you’re not getting the help you think you should be getting, ask to speak with supervisors.
Use formal complaint procedures and appeal processes.
Or find someone who knows the system well to help you (like a case manager, behavioral health navigator, legal aid worker, or peer advocate).

### <a id="work-with-multiple-providers">Work with Multiple Service Providers</a>

Tell each provider about other services you get, when it matters.
For example, tell housing programs about your income sources.
But casual services like showers don’t need to know about each other.

If an agency plans to apply for a service in your name, tell them if you already applied on your own.
This prevents duplicate applications and wasted time.
Keep track of which applications you made or that others made for you.
This helps you avoid doing the same thing twice.

Share information with service providers that relates directly to the services you want.
For example, share your income for benefits applications or your medical history for healthcare.
Keep other personal details private if you don’t feel like sharing them.

Keep a list of contact information for all your service providers.
Ask for direct phone numbers or business cards from people who work with you.
This helps you avoid phone trees if you need to call back.

### <a id="set-goals-and-track-progress">Set Goals and Track Progress</a>

Make your goals “S.M.A.R.T.” (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound). <!-- Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria -->
Divide big goals (like getting housing) into smaller steps you can manage.
Notice and celebrate your achievements, even small ones.
Be flexible and willing to change your goals as your situation changes.

### <a id="when-things-go-wrong">When Things Go Wrong</a>

Even when you feel frustrated, stay calm and speak respectfully.
This approach usually gets better results and faster solutions than arguing.
Note details about problems, including dates, names, and what went wrong.
Don’t quit too soon.
Persevering often pays off when you work with complex systems.

### <a id="find-and-use-resources">Find and Use Resources</a>

Use this guide or call [211](tel:+1-211) to get information about available services. <!-- Source: https://211slo.org/ -->
Talk with other people in similar situations—they often have valuable information and tips.

The [Other Guides](#other-guides) section of this guide lists some other resource guides that may have information this guide missed.

Things change.
Contact service providers directly to verify their most current information before you travel to their locations.

### <a id="overnight-shelter">Overnight Shelter</a>

If you are unsheltered and need a place to sleep tonight, these are some options:

The [**40 Prado Homeless Services Center**](Directory.md#40-Prado) has a hundred overnight shelter beds. <!-- Source: https://capslo.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/CAPSLO-40-Prado-Goes-Green-May-2023.pdf -->
Many are reserved for people who have previously registered with 40 Prado, but a limited number are available on a walk-in basis. <!-- SOURCE NEEDED (issue #51) -->
To get a bed, first come on-site and complete the intake process. <!-- SOURCE NEEDED (issue #51) -->
Thereafter, on any day when you need an overnight shelter bed, check in to secure a bed or to be placed on the waiting list. <!-- SOURCE NEEDED (issue #51) -->
Priority is given to SLO county residents. <!-- SOURCE NEEDED (issue #51) -->

If you are homeless and have a medically verified need for 24/7 temporary housing because you are seriously ill, recovering from surgery or injury or high-risk pregnancy, or something of that nature, you may qualify for the [**Medically Fragile Homeless Program**](Directory.md#Medically-Fragile-Homeless-Program). <!-- Source: https://cfsslo.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/MFH-Program-FAQ_2025.pdf -->
They will help you with immediate housing, supportive services and coordinated case management to ensure physical recovery, access to income sources, connection to services, and a more permanent housing alternative when you exit the program. <!-- Source: https://cfsslo.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/MFH-Program-FAQ_2025.pdf -->
You cannot apply for this program yourself, but you must get a referral from an agency like [**Adult Protective Services**](Directory.md#Adult-Protective-Services),<!-- Source: https://cfsslo.org/#mfh -->

#### A Note About “In-Home” Supportive Services
<!-- Note: not sure where this section belongs. I could see a case for it being in the “Medical/Health” section, or maybe in the section on services for particular groups (e.g. elderly/disabled/blind). People who are looking for this information seem unlikely to search for it by going to the the “Housing” section. -->

The [**In-Home Supportive Services (IHSS)**](Directory.md#In-Home-Supportive-Services) Program helps pay for services provided to senior, blind, or disabled people who have difficulty caring for themselves and cannot live at home safely without in-home care. <!-- Source: https://www.slocounty.ca.gov/departments/social-services/adult-services/services/in-home-supportive-services-%28ihss%29-program -->
Despite the “in-home” name, this program is potentially also available to people who shelter at homeless shelters or safe-parking sites.<!-- according to the long-term care ombudsman at the Collaborative Outreach Meeting on 5 Nov 2025 -->
Among the services that this program can help pay for are meal preparation, laundry, grocery shopping, personal care services (such as bowel and bladder care, bathing, grooming and paramedical services, help getting dressed, help getting into and out of a wheelchair), and accompaniment to medical appointments. <!-- Source: https://www.slocounty.ca.gov/departments/social-services/adult-services/services/in-home-supportive-services-%28ihss%29-program -->

To qualify for IHSS, you must be disabled, blind, or age 65 or older. <!-- Source: https://www.slocounty.ca.gov/departments/social-services/adult-services/services/in-home-supportive-services-%28ihss%29-program -->
You must also be unable to live safely in your current home or shelter environment without assistance, and you must be financially needy. <!-- Source: https://www.slocounty.ca.gov/departments/social-services/adult-services/services/in-home-supportive-services-%28ihss%29-program -->
The process of applying for IHSS is difficult, so it is a good idea for you to get some help from a case manager or other social worker. <!-- according to the long-term care ombudsman at the Collaborative Outreach Meeting on 5 Nov 2025 -->

### <a id="transitional-and-long-term-housing">Transitional and Long-Term Housing</a>

This section discusses more long-term housing options including *transitional housing* (a temporary home while you search for more long-term housing) and *affordable housing* or *subsidized housing* (a long-term home).

The [**Coordinated Entry System (CES)**](Directory.md#CES) is SLO county’s system for matching people in need with transitional or long-term housing that is appropriate for them.
If you want to get such housing, you should try to enter this system.
This can be more effective than trying to contact the many individual transitional or long-term housing programs one at a time.
To enter this system, contact one of the many participating agencies, such as [**SLO County Department of Social Services**](Directory.md#SLO-County-Department-of-Social-Services), [**5Cities Homeless Coalition**](Directory.md#5CHC), [**Community Action Partnership San Luis Obispo (CAPSLO)**](Directory.md#CAPSLO), [**Transitions Mental Health Association**](Directory.md#TMHA), [**Good Samaritan Shelter**](Directory.md#Good-Samaritan-Shelter), or [**SLO County Health Department**](Directory.md#SLO-County-Health-Department). <!-- SOURCE NEEDED -->

A program called [**Housing Now**](Directory.md#Housing-Now) finds homes for the most vulnerable chronically homeless people from SLO County.
You cannot apply directly to participate in this program, but if you enter the Coordinated Entry System (see above), that system may eventually place you in this program so that you can quickly get a home. <!-- SOURCE NEEDED -->

If you need such housing and Medi-Cal is your only health insurance, you can get on a waiting list for a facility outside of SLO County. <!-- Source: Collaborative Outreach Meeting on 5 Nov 2025 -->
This is a lengthy process, so if you think you might need such a living situation in the future (even as long as a year or more from now), you should try to start this process now. <!-- Source: Collaborative Outreach Meeting on 5 Nov 2025 -->

## <a id="property-storage">Property Storage Options</a>

### <a id="short-term-property-storage">Short-Term</a>

If you need to securely store a small amount of property for a few hours or overnight, you have a few options:

The [**40 Prado Homeless Services Center**](Directory.md#40-Prado) has storage lockers available <!-- Source: https://friendsof40prado.org/about/ --> for people who complete intake for day services there. <!-- SOURCE NEEDED (issue #51) -->
You must provide your own padlock. <!-- SOURCE NEEDED (issue #51) -->

The commercial service [Bounce](https://bounce.com/) partners with multiple locations (in SLO County, these are typically UPS Stores) to offer short-term luggage storage that typically runs about $7 per day or $20–80 per month (depending on weight and size).
You can find the specific locations, terms and conditions, and costs at their website. <!-- SOURCE NEEDED -->

In a few locations in SLO County (Morro St. in SLO, at Cal Poly, and at the Curbaril Park-n-Ride in Atascadero) you can find [on-demand bike lockers](https://rideshare.org/bike-lockers/).
These cost 5¢ per hour and can be rented for up to seven consecutive days. <!-- Source: https://rideshare.org/bike-lockers/ -->
Use the [BikeLink](https://www.bikelink.org/) app to access and pay for these lockers. <!-- Source: https://rideshare.org/bike-lockers/ -->
They are for bicycles only (you cannot use them to store other personal belongings like carts or suitcases), but you can probably get away with storing pannier bags along with your bicycle. <!-- Source: https://rideshare.org/bike-lockers/ -->

### <a id="long-term-property-storage">Long-Term</a>

There are several commercial long-term storage options in SLO County.
You can find these by doing a web search for terms like “self storage” or “mini storage”.
They typically rent spaces by the month, and have different-sized units available at different prices.
5′×5′, 5′×10′, and 10′×10′ units are typical.
You can expect to pay about $60–75 per month for the least-expensive and smallest sizes, up to $150 for larger sizes. <!-- SOURCE NEEDED -->
Most storage facilities have daytime hours of operation when you can access the storage units to add or remove property, and are closed to everyone at night.

### <a id="recovering-seized-property">Recovering Property Taken During Arrests or Encampment Sweeps</a>

Different agencies take responsibility for clearing homeless camps, depending on where the camps are located.
These agencies have different policies about whether, to what extent, and for how long they will store property that they clear from encampments, so that the owners of that property can recover it.

They typically will only store certain items of property, and will discard things that are hazardous, soiled, or decayed or that seem to them like mere trash.
They often store all items taken from an encampment sweep in one big pile, which can make it difficult for you to find your own items.

Grover Beach will post a notice *after* they do an encampment sweep, at the encampment’s former location, “stating where the personal property is being stored, and listing the phone number and hours a person claiming ownership can collect or make arrangements to collect their personal property.” <!-- Source: Grover Beach Municipal Code 14.3997.9.D.8 -->
They will store some belongings for 90 days before discarding them. <!-- Source: Grover Beach Municipal Code 14.3997.9.D.8 -->

Morro Bay stores some property taken during encampment sweeps for 90 days before discarding it. <!-- Source: Morro Bay Municipal Code 8.26.040.B.1 -->
Their policy is to post a notice where they plan to do encampment sweeps 72 hours before they begin, and those notices should include the address, phone number, and operating hours of the location where personal property will be stored. <!-- Source: Morro Bay Municipal Code 8.26.040.B.1 -->

SLO City stores some property taken during encampment sweeps for 90 days before discarding it. <!-- Source: https://www.slocity.org/living/neighborhood/homelessness/camp#storage -->
If you have had property taken in this way, call either the Public Works Department ([805-781-7220](tel:+1-805-781-7220)) or the Ranger Service Department ([805-781-7302](tel:+1-805-781-7302)) and give them a detailed description of your property. <!-- Source: https://www.slocity.org/living/neighborhood/homelessness/camp#storage -->
If they think they may have it, you can make an appointment to retrieve it. <!-- Source: https://www.slocity.org/living/neighborhood/homelessness/camp#storage -->

If your property was seized from an camp sweep along the highway, on-ramp / off-ramp, or overpass / underpass, this may have been done by Caltrans.
They should post notices where they plan to do encampment sweeps 72 hours before they begin, and those notices should include a phone number you can call to get assistance in retrieving your property. <!-- Source: Caltrans maintenance manual 1.07.3-4 https://dot.ca.gov/-/media/dot-media/programs/maintenance/documents/3-chpt-1-july-2015-rev-1-02-a11y.pdf -->
If they failed to post notices ahead of time, they should post notices afterwards that describe where items were removed from, a contact number to call to reclaim them, and the date by which they must be reclaimed. <!-- Source: Caltrans maintenance manual 1.07.3-4 https://dot.ca.gov/-/media/dot-media/programs/maintenance/documents/3-chpt-1-july-2015-rev-1-02-a11y.pdf -->
They will not sift through belongings to identify valuable items, but if they see “items of apparent value” in plain sight, they will treat them as privately owned, lost, discarded, abandoned, or stolen property and hold it for 90 days after removing it before disposing of it. <!-- Source: Caltrans maintenance manual 1.07.3-4 https://dot.ca.gov/-/media/dot-media/programs/maintenance/documents/3-chpt-1-july-2015-rev-1-02-a11y.pdf -->

If a different agency from those was responsible for the sweep, try discovering which agency it was, and then contact them directly.

If you were separated from your property because you were arrested, it is possible that those who arrested you did not make any attempt to secure your belongings.
They may have just left them wherever they were when you were arrested.
If they did secure your belongings, they should return these to you when you are released from jail or they should tell you the process you can use to retrieve them, unless they are keeping the property as evidence.

In the case of the SLO County Sheriff, if they were keeping the property as evidence but then decide to return it to you, they will inform you by sending you a letter that tells you where to retrieve the property. <!-- Source: Probation Department Policy/Procedure Manual 5.6.12 https://www.slocounty.ca.gov/departments/probation/forms-documents/education-and-training-materials-documents/procedures/5-support-services-procedures/evidence/5-6-property-evidence-manual -->
You then have 30 days to retrieve the property, or it may be destroyed. <!-- Source: Probation Department Policy/Procedure Manual 5.6.12 https://www.slocounty.ca.gov/departments/probation/forms-documents/education-and-training-materials-documents/procedures/5-support-services-procedures/evidence/5-6-property-evidence-manual -->
If you do not have a stable mailing address, or if the Sheriffs Department does not know your mailing address, you may never see this letter!
In such a case, you may want to contact the Sheriffs department to let them know how to contact you if they decide to release your property.

Food pantries give away unprepared food (such as fresh produce, canned goods, and packaged food).
Some pantries have special no-cook, no-refrigeration, ready-to-eat options for people who do not have access to kitchens.
Some give you a pre-prepared box or bag of food, others allow you to select particular items you want.

### <a id="little-free-pantries">Little Free Pantries</a>

Little free pantries are small boxes erected in neighborhoods and maintained by the people who live nearby.
They are self-serve and open 24/7.
They are stocked by people who have extra things to give away.
You never know quite what you will find there, but there is usually some canned and packaged non-perishable food, and sometimes toiletries and other small essentials.

Sometimes people put perishable food in little free pantries, but you should beware of eating such food as it may have been there for a while and may no longer be safe to eat.

See [**Little Free Pantries**](Directory.md#Little-Free-Pantries) in the [Directory](Directory.md) for a list of locations.

The CalFresh program is California’s version of the federal nutrition program known as “SNAP” or “food stamps.” <!-- Source: https://www.getcalfresh.org/ -->
If you have a low income, California gives you an “EBT card” which you can use like a debit card at grocery stores and farmers markets to buy healthy foods. <!-- Source: https://www.getcalfresh.org/ -->

You can apply for CalFresh online at either of the following sites:

- [BenefitsCal.com](https://benefitscal.com/) <!-- Source: https://www.getcalfresh.org/ -->
- [GetCalFresh.org](https://www.getcalfresh.org/) <!-- Source: https://www.getcalfresh.org/ -->

If you are a Cal Poly student, you can get assistance from the [Cal Poly CalFresh Program](https://www.calfreshcalpoly.org/).

You will need some identification document, proof of income, and (for students) indication of student status, and (for non-citizens) immigration status. <!-- Source: https://www.getcalfresh.org/en/faq -->
Suitable proof of income includes pay stubs from last 30 days, an employer letter on company letterhead, tax forms (1040, W-2, 1099), self-employment profit/loss statement or ledger, or a signed written statement if you do not have those documents. <!-- SOURCE NEEDED -->
See [calfresh.guide](https://calfresh.guide/verifications-the-calfresh-office-requires/) for more details.

Some local farmers markets will double up to $15 in CalFresh benefits that you spend at the market, so you can get twice as much food for your money (see [slocountyfarmers.org](https://www.slocountyfarmers.org/snap) for details): <!-- Source: https://ecologycenter.org/fmfinder/ -->

### <a id="edible-wild-plants">Edible Wild Plants</a>

There are many edible wild plants available in SLO County.
When they are in season, they can add nutrition to your diet.

> **Caution:** Some wild plants are poisonous.
> You should only forage for wild plants if you know what you are doing.
> Also: beware of foraging plants in agricultural or well-tended areas, as they may have been treated with pesticides.
> Don’t forage plants from waste sites, stagnant water areas, or areas subject to agricultural or industrial run-off, as the plants may absorb toxins or parasites from the soil or water.

Some common edible plants in SLO County are: <!-- Source: Gary Romano "Hiker's guide to wild edible plants of San Luis Obispo County" -->

Sometimes you will also see edible fruit trees like plums or cherries on sidewalks, in parks, or in other public places.

Sometimes also people plant fruit trees on their own property but then neglect to harvest the fruit, perhaps because there is more than they need.
In such a case you can ask the property owner for permission to harvest from their trees.

## <a id="refill-a-water-bottle">Where to Refill a Water Bottle</a>

Most major parks and recreation facilities have water fountains and/or water bottle refill stations, as do some public libraries. <!-- SOURCE NEEDED -->

The city of SLO also has a water bottle filling station network.
Some of these stations are inside buildings and are only accessible when the building is open for business.
Others are outside and are available 24/7.
You can find a map of these hydration stations [at this link](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/ac825840143c4d718e06397d5306fa89) or at [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?mid=1ojOfK6l3mkAh6JIfFJZwA5ej5Qj232No&ll=35.27079109833796%2C-120.65453885&z=15).

### <a id="public-transit">Public Transit</a>

There are many public transit options in SLO County.
The [Rideshare](https://rideshare.org/) website and the [511](tel:+1-511) phone service can give you an overview of most of them and can help you plan your trips.

The [**SLO Regional Transit Authority**](Directory.md#SLO-RTA) system includes several bus routes that connect cities in SLO County.
They also govern the city bus routes in Morro Bay and Paso Robles, and the dial-a-ride and Runabout Paratransit services.
You can buy bus passes on the bus or by using the [Token Transit](https://tokentransit.com/riders/download) app.

There are discounts for seniors (age 65+), medicare card holders, and people with disabilities. <!-- Source: https://www.slorta.org/fares/discounts/ -->
You must apply in person at the RTA office to get a discount card. <!-- Source https://www.slorta.org/fares/discounts/ -->
People over the age of 80 and people with an ADA-certified disability ride free. <!-- Source: https://www.slorta.org/fares/discounts/ -->

[Runabout Paratransit](https://www.slorta.org/services/runabout-paratransit/) is a county-wide transit service for people who cannot always use the fixed-route SLO RTA buses because of disability. <!-- Source: https://www.slorta.org/services/runabout-paratransit/ -->
This service will take you door-to-door within ¾-mile of the RTA fixed routes during the same hours RTA operates. <!-- Source: https://www.slorta.org/services/runabout-paratransit/ -->
One personal care attendant can accompany you free-of-charge. <!-- Source: https://www.slorta.org/services/runabout-paratransit/faq/ -->
You have to apply and have an in-person interview to be eligible for this service (see [**SLO Regional Transit Authority**](Directory.md#SLO-RTA) for contact information). <!-- Source: https://www.slorta.org/services/runabout-paratransit/ -->
After you register, make ride reservations 1–7 days in advance by calling [805-541-2544](tel:+1-805-541-2544). <!-- Source: https://www.slorta.org/services/runabout-paratransit/ -->
Rides are not free; they cost about twice as much as ordinary RTA rides. <!-- Source: https://www.slorta.org/services/runabout-paratransit/ -->
However people who qualify to use Runabout Paratransit can also ride the ordinary RTA service for free. <!-- Source: https://www.slorta.org/fares/discounts/ -->

[**SLO Transit**](Directory.md#SLO-Transit) is the San Luis Obispo city bus system.
You can use the [SLO Transit RiderPortal](https://slo.rider.peaktransit.com/) website or phone app ([iPhone](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/slo-transit/id458554556?mt=8), [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=edu.calpoly.android.SloBusMapper&hl=en)) to view routes and to see when the next bus is due to arrive.
You can buy bus passes on the bus or by using the [Token Transit](https://tokentransit.com/riders/download) app.
(Another option for viewing bus arrival times and for planning travel is the [moovit](https://moovitapp.com/index/en/public_transit-San_Luis_Obispo_CA-4003) app.)
There are discounts for seniors and disabled people (you may need to [apply for a special card](https://forms.slocity.org/Forms/SDPassApp)), and for children. <!-- Source: https://www.slocity.org/government/department-directory/public-works/slo-transit/discount-programs -->
If you buy a regional day pass from SLO RTA, that also lets you ride SLO Transit buses. <!-- Source: https://www.slocity.org/government/department-directory/public-works/slo-transit/fare-information -->

Some service providers can give you a bus pass if you cannot afford to buy one.
For example, [**Catholic Charities**](Directory.md#Catholic-Charities) <!-- SOURCE NEEDED (issue #55) -->
and the [**Society of St. Vincent de Paul**](Directory.md#Society-of-St-Vincent-de-Paul) often have bus passes available to people who need them. <!-- SOURCE NEEDED (issue #55) -->
Clients of [**Tri-Counties Regional Center**](Directory.md#Tri-Counties-Regional-Center) can get bus passes from them. <!-- SOURCE NEEDED (issue #55) -->
The [**Family Care Network**](Directory.md#Family-Care-Network) can help you get a bus pass if you cannot afford one on your own (you may first need to get a referral from a [**SLO County Department of Social Services**](Directory.md#SLO-County-Department-of-Social-Services) Employment Resource Specialist). <!-- SOURCE NEEDED (issue #55) (mentioned briefly at https://fcni.org/partner-with-us/fam/) -->

You can find carpool options locally by using the [iRideshare](https://irideshare.org/#/) web application, a free program for SLO County commuters.
The application matches commuters based on their locations, routes, destinations, and schedules to try to match them into compatible carpools.

If you register for iRideshare and you commute to work by walking, biking, taking the bus, or in a carpool or vanpool, and you need to get home from work in some other way (for example, because the carpool is leaving at the wrong time, or because your bike broke), the [Guaranteed Ride Home](https://rideshare.org/program/guaranteed-ride-home/) program will pay for your taxi, Uber, or Lyft ride home.
(You need to register for their Commuter Club program, save your ride payment receipt, and you can only get a limited number of guaranteed rides home.) <!-- Source: https://rideshare.org/program/guaranteed-ride-home/ -->

There are [Dial-A-Ride](https://www.slorta.org/services/dial-a-ride/) services in Atascadero, Morro Bay, Nipomo, Paso Robles, Shandon, and Templeton.
They typically offer curb-to-curb service and charge $2.25–8.00 each way (sometimes less for seniors, disabled people, and children): <!-- Source: https://www.slorta.org/services/dial-a-ride/ -->

### <a id="bicycles">Bicycles</a>

The [**Bike Kitchen**](Directory.md#Bike-Kitchen) in SLO city can help you learn how to do maintenance and repairs on your bicycle, and can give you access to the tools and supplies you need. <!-- Source: https://bikeslocounty.org/programs/kitchen/ -->
They also sell refurbished bicycles at low prices. <!-- Source: https://bikeslocounty.org/programs/kitchen/ -->

They charge a small fee ($10/hr) to use their repair/maintenance services. <!-- https://bikeslocounty.org/programs/kitchen/#tab-id-2 -->

Here are some tips for keeping your bike safe if you are camping:

- Lock bikes together when you camp with multiple people.
- Position your bike near your tent and thread one of the tent’s guy-lines through the wheel, so your tent will shake if someone moves the bike.
- Use multiple locks (for example, a U-lock and a cable). Avoid using cable locks only, as they are relatively easy to break.
- Consider using a lock that makes an audible alarm when it is tampered with.

### <a id="emergency-care">Emergency Care</a>

#### When and How to Call 911

Call 911 immediately when someone needs emergency medical care that cannot wait.
This includes when a person:

- Cannot breathe or struggles severely to breathe
- Has no pulse or appears unconscious and unresponsive
- Bleeds heavily and cannot stop the bleeding
- Shows signs of stroke (sudden face drooping, arm weakness, or speech difficulty)
- Experiences chest pain that might indicate a heart attack
- Has a severe allergic reaction with swelling or breathing problems
- Suffers a serious injury
- Takes a dangerous overdose of a drug or poison
- Has a seizure (especially if it lasts longer than five minutes or if the person has never had a seizure before)
- Has a severe mental health crisis in which they are an immediate danger to themselves or others

Stay calm and speak clearly to the 911 dispatcher.
The dispatcher will guide you through the process, and may ask you for:

- **Your exact location** — Give the full address, including apartment number, floor, or any access instructions. If you’re unsure of the address, describe nearby landmarks or cross streets.
- **The nature of the emergency** — Briefly describe what happened and the person’s current condition.
- **The patient’s condition** — Report whether the person is conscious, breathing, and responsive. Describe visible injuries or symptoms.
- **Your relationship to the patient** — State whether you are family, a friend, or a bystander.
- **Your contact information** — Provide a phone number where responders can reach you.

Do not hang up until the dispatcher tells you to.
The dispatcher may tell you how to provide care while you wait for help to arrive.
If the situation changes while you wait, call 911 again immediately to update them.

Stay with the patient until help arrives, if it is safe for you to do so.
Choose someone to watch for the ambulance and to guide responders to the location.

#### Emergency Rooms

There are four emergency rooms in SLO County:

1. [**Arroyo Grande Community Hospital**](Directory.md#Arroyo-Grande-Community-Hospital) (Arroyo Grande)
1. [**Adventist Health Sierra Vista**](Directory.md#Adventist-Health-Sierra-Vista) (SLO)
1. [**French Hospital Medical Center**](Directory.md#French-Hospital-Medical-Center) (SLO)
1. [**Adventist Health Twin Cities**](Directory.md#Adventist-Health-Twin-Cities) (Templeton)

These emergency rooms are open all day, every day.

Do not worry if your Medi-Cal paperwork is not yet in order.
Under the “Hospital Presumptive Eligibility” program, in an emergency, hospitals will treat you as though you have Medi-Cal for up to two months while they work with you to determine your eligibility, if the following conditions hold:<!-- Source: https://www.dhcs.ca.gov/services/medi-cal/eligibility/Pages/HospitalPE.aspx-Cal -->

- You are uninsured and not receiving Medi-Cal.
- You have a low monthly income.
- You live in California.
- You have not used the “Hospital Presumptive Eligibility” program more than once in the past 12 months (more than twice for children).

U.S. Citizenship is not required. <!-- Source: https://www.slohealthaccess.org/medi-cal.html -->
All four emergency rooms participate in the “Hospital Presumptive Eligibility” program. <!-- Source: https://www.slohealthaccess.org/medi-cal.html -->

### <a id="urgent-care">Urgent Care Options</a>

Visit an urgent care center when you have a medical problem that needs prompt attention but is not life-threatening.
Urgent care centers treat conditions that are too serious to wait for a doctor’s appointment but that do not require emergency room services.
The wait is usually shorter than emergency rooms, and the cost is typically lower for non-emergency conditions.
Most urgent care centers accept walk-ins, and some also allow appointments.
Bring your insurance card, identification, and a list of medications you take.

Poison oak is a common plant in SLO County and grows everywhere from shaded wet creek beds to dry sunny hillsides. <!-- Sources: https://www.calflora.org/entry/observ.html#srch=t&taxon=Toxicodendron+diversilobum&lpcli=t&cch=t&inat=r&chk=t&cc=SLO and https://ucjeps.berkeley.edu/eflora/eflora_display.php?tid=46791 -->
It is a shrub or vine and sometimes also climbs trees and so can appear to be tree branches. <!-- Source: https://www.fs.usda.gov/database/feis/plants/vine/toxdiv/all.html -->
Its leaves appear in groups of three, but they can have a variety of shapes and colors (dark to pale green, pale orange, bright red). <!-- Source: https://ucjeps.berkeley.edu/eflora/eflora_display.php?tid=46791 -->
The plants sometimes also display clusters of tiny green, pale, or brown fruits. <!-- Source: https://ipm.ucanr.edu/PMG/WEEDS/pacific_poisonoak.html -->

</div>

The plant exudes an oil that causes a skin rash in people who touch it. <!-- Source: https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/poison-ivy%2D%2Dpoison-oak -->
You do not have to touch the plant to be affected: you just need to touch the oil, which can rub off onto clothing, pet fur, or other items and may remain poisonous for years. <!-- Source: https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/poison-ivy%2D%2Dpoison-oak -->
If you have been near a fire in which poison oak plants were burned, you may be exposed to the oil through the smoke. <!-- Source: https://ipm.ucanr.edu/home-and-landscape/poison-oak/#gsc.tab=0 -->
You can prevent the rash by washing your skin thoroughly as soon as possible after exposure and by washing any clothing or other items that may be carrying the oil. <!-- Source: https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/poison-ivy%2D%2Dpoison-oak -->
Rubbing alcohol or detergent soaps can be helpful in removing oils. <!-- Sources: https://ipm.ucanr.edu/home-and-landscape/poison-oak/#INTRODUCTION_65_1 and https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2010-118/default.html -->

The rash typically appears 12–48 hours, or even several days after exposure. <!-- Sources: https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/poison-ivy/symptoms-causes/syc-20376485 and https://www.healthline.com/health/outdoor-health/poison-oak-pictures-remedies -->
It is typically very itchy, and sometimes blisters.
You can treat the rash with over-the-counter steroid (such as hydrocortisone) creams, calamine lotion, or antihistamines. <!-- Source: https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/poison-ivy/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20376490 -->

If you have trouble breathing or swallowing, you may have inhaled some oils (for example from smoke) and you may be experiencing severe respiratory irritation. <!-- Source: https://ipm.ucanr.edu/home-and-landscape/poison-oak/#gsc.tab=0 -->
In such a case you should seek medical attention.

### <a id="sunburn">Sunburn</a>

Sunburn is painful. <!-- Source: https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/sunburn/symptoms-causes/syc-20355922 -->
It also can make you fatigued and more susceptible to infection. <!-- Sources: https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/sunburn/symptoms-causes/syc-20355922 and https://www.cancer.org/cancer/risk-prevention/sun-and-uv/uv-radiation.html -->
In the long run it can put you at higher risk of developing skin cancer. <!-- Source: https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/sunburn/symptoms-causes/syc-20355922 -->

Homeless people are more prone to sunburn because they have fewer options to escape the mid-day sun.
You can reduce your risk of sunburn by finding shady places to rest during the day, by wearing more thoroughly-covering clothing like long-sleeved shirts and broad-brimmed hats, and by applying sunscreen. <!-- Source: https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/sunburn/symptoms-causes/syc-20355922 -->
Ask homeless service providers if they have any sunscreen they can give you. Sometimes they do.

> See the [Clothing](#clothing) section of this guide for some tips on where to find free or low-cost clothing.

If you develop a sunburn, you can get some relief with over-the-counter salves and creams, or just by keeping the area moist (perhaps with a dampened cloth). <!-- Source: https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-sunburn/basics/art-20056643 -->
If you have blisters that break, keep the area clean and covered with a bandage. <!-- Source: https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-sunburn/basics/art-20056643 -->
If you notice increasing redness that spreads beyond the area of the burn, or pus, or if you develop a fever, seek medical care as this may indicate an infection. <!-- Source: https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/sunburn/symptoms-causes/syc-20355922 -->

## <a id="tattoo-removal">Tattoo Removal</a>

There are programs available that will erase your tattoos.
This can help you if you have tattoos that interfere with your ability to get a job or that are suggestive of gang or hate group affiliation.
Tattoo removal can help you get a fresh start, unburdened by regretful decisions from your past. <!-- Source: https://removery.com/tattoo-removal/ -->

The process of laser tattoo removal takes time.
Typically you undergo between five and twelve visits, each one lasting about five minutes, over several months.
In each visit a laser breaks ink particles in your tattoo so that your immune system can remove them. <!-- Source: https://removery.com/tattoo-removal/ -->
The tattooed area will become red and swollen soon after treatment, but this eventually settles down.
Sometimes there is some blistering and scabbing.
You will need to take some care to keep the area of the tattoo clean, and to apply some ointments that assist healing. <!-- Source: https://removery.com/tattoo-removal/aftercare/ -->

The [**Liberty Tattoo Removal Program**](Directory.md#Liberty-Tattoo-Removal-Program) offers laser tattoo removal of gang-related, anti-social, or economically limiting tattoos. <!-- Source: https://capslo.org/liberty-tattoo-removal/ -->
You are required to do some hours of community service (or an equivalent financial donation) before each treatment, but there is otherwise no cost. <!-- Source: https://capslo.org/liberty-tattoo-removal/ -->
You must agree to remain clean and sober, and to get no more tattoos, during the treatment. <!-- Source: https://capslo.org/liberty-tattoo-removal/ -->
The treatments happen in Arroyo Grande. <!-- Source: https://capslo.org/liberty-tattoo-removal/ -->

[**Catholic Charities**](Directory.md#Catholic-Charities) has a low-cost tattoo removal program ($20–90 per session, on a sliding scale based on ability to pay). <!-- Source: https://catholiccharitiesdom.org/tattoo-removal-program/ -->
You must also complete 20 hours of community service before beginning treatment. <!-- Source: https://catholiccharitiesdom.org/tattoo-removal-program/ -->
They prioritize the removal of offensive or gang-related tattoos, and will remove both visible-and-obvious tattoos (e.g. the face, the back of the hands) and more discreet ones. <!-- Source: https://catholiccharitiesdom.org/tattoo-removal-program/ -->
Call them to begin the process. <!-- Source: https://catholiccharitiesdom.org/tattoo-removal-program/ -->

The [Removery INK-nitiative Program](https://removery.com/services/ink-nitiative) offers free removal of tattoos, if those tattoos are in visible areas (face, hands, arms) or suggest gang or hate group affiliation, to people who have been incarcerated, are former gang members, or are survivors of domestic abuse or human trafficking. <!-- Source: https://removery.com/services/ink-nitiative/ -->

- [Advance Directives](#advance-directives)

### <a id="hospice-and-palliative-care">Hospice and Palliative Care Services</a>

Palliative care is medical treatment that aims to relieve pain and suffering, perhaps alongside medical treatment that hopes to cure or treat some health problem.

Hospice care is meant to make the process of dying less uncomfortable, and is meant for people who do not have realistic hopes of being cured and living long.
Typically this means they are in their last six months of life.

[**Hospice SLO**](Directory.md#Hospice-SLO) includes non-medical volunteer support, grief counseling, support groups, in-home respite care, care management, and end-of-life companion support. <!-- Source: https://hospiceslo.org/ -->
All services are provided at no charge (they rely entirely on community donations). <!-- Source: https://hospiceslo.org/ -->
These services are open to San Luis Obispo County residents grieving a death, coping with life-limiting illness, or facing end of life. <!-- Source: https://hospiceslo.org/ -->

The [**Medically Fragile Homeless Program**](Directory.md#Medically-Fragile-Homeless-Program) provides shelter to terminally ill people who need housing so that they can die in the dignity and stability of housing with the care of hospice. <!-- Source: https://cfsslo.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/MFH-Program-FAQ_2025.pdf -->

[**Aevum Home Health**](Directory.md#Aevum) offers palliative care, and accepts Medicare and Medi-Cal. <!-- Source: https://www.aevumhomehealth.com/services -->

They accept Medicare. <!-- Source: https://centralcoasthomehealth.com/index.php/about-us/ -->

[**Dignity Health**](Directory.md#Dignity-Health) has a Home Health and Hospice program that includes team-oriented medical care, symptom and pain management, and emotional and spiritual support tailored to patient needs. <!-- Source: https://www.dignityhealth.org/central-coast/services/home-health-hospice-and-infusion-services -->
They accept Medicare and Medi-Cal. <!-- SOURCE NEEDED -->
They also have financial assistance programs that make hospice treatment free for people below 250% of the federal poverty level, and discounted for people below 400% of the federal poverty level (call [888-488-7667](tel:+1-888-488-7667) or [805-542-6321](tel:+1-805-542-6321) for details). <!-- Source: https://www.dignityhealth.org/central-coast/locations/arroyo-grande/patients-and-visitors/for-patients/billing-information/financial-assistance -->

Hospice care is part of the Veterans Health Administration (VHA)’s medical benefits package for all enrolled veterans. <!-- Source: https://www.va.gov/geriatrics/pages/Hospice_Care.asp -->
If you are a veteran who is enrolled with the VHA, and you have a clinical need for end-of-life hospice care, you can get this without a copay through the VHA. <!-- Source: https://www.va.gov/geriatrics/pages/Hospice_Care.asp -->

### <a id="advance-directives">Advance Directives</a>

<!-- See issue #37 -->

Advance Health Care Directives are legal documents that let you communicate your health care wishes in advance, in case you become unable to speak for yourself.
Sometimes people call these “Living Wills.”
These documents include:

- **Advance Health Care Directives:** Specifies which medical treatments you would or would not want if you become terminally ill or are in a persistent vegetative state
- **Healthcare Power of Attorney:** Designates a trusted person to make medical decisions for you when you cannot
- **Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment (POLST):** You can use this to tell physicians how much they should intervene to try to extend your life
- **Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) Orders:** Expresses your desire to refuse resuscitation efforts in particular
- **Organ Donation Authorization:** You give or withhold permission for your organs, tissues, or body parts to be donated when you die, or put conditions on how they can be used

These documents help to ensure that your healthcare wishes are respected even if you are incapacitated and cannot express them yourself.
They usually must be signed by you *and* by certain witnesses to be effective.
It is a good idea to create such documents *before* you need them, as when you need them you will be preoccupied or unable.
Give these documents to your healthcare providers so they know to respect your specific preferences.

The free websites [PREPARE for Your Care](https://prepareforyourcare.org/) and [The Conversation Project](https://theconversationproject.org/) can help you create advance directive documents that match your needs and your preferences.
The [California Advance Directive Form](https://eforms.com/power-of-attorney/ca/california-advanced-health-care-directive/) website has several varieties of advance directive forms in PDF format that you can review or print.

### <a id="personal-safety-tips">Personal Safety Tips</a>

To stay safe on the streets, stay aware of your surroundings.
Be alert when you walk alone, and avoid distractions like phones or headphones.
Trust your instincts—if a situation feels unsafe, go somewhere safer.
Walk with confidence: keep your eyes forward, and maintain a steady pace.
These simple behaviors can make you less vulnerable to potential threats.

Learning to identify trustworthy people is one of the most important street skills you can develop, though it takes time and experience.
Be cautious when forming new relationships—sometimes people experiencing homelessness are victimized by people who say they want to help.
Watch for “red flags” like people who try to exploit your vulnerabilities, who offer deals that seem too good to be true, or who pressure you into uncomfortable or vulnerable situations.
Connect with peers who understand your situation, as these relationships often provide both safety and emotional support.
Remember that developing good judgment about people is a gradual process, not something you can master immediately.

Whenever possible, travel with trusted companions rather than going places alone.
Having someone you trust with you provides both practical safety and moral support.
Build a network of friends who protect each other.
Such connections improve your physical safety and also your overall well-being and security.

If you use emergency shelters, address your security concerns with the staff before you settle in.
(For example, if you see someone at the shelter who has been threatening to you in the past, or if you are not sure your possessions will be secure where you have been told to leave them.)
Some people choose to sleep on the streets rather than in shelters because of safety concerns.
If you do stay outside, you need to balance the risks of harassment in public places against the risk of assault in more secluded areas.
Stay vigilant even in places that are supposed to be safe.

If you find yourself in a dangerous situation, your primary goal should be to escape and get help rather than to fight.
The best approach to self-defense is to avoid physical violence through awareness and de-escalation.
If you do need to defend yourself, learn a few simple techniques that can make an attacker reconsider and give you time to get away.
When possible, take formal self-defense classes to learn proper techniques from trained instructors.

## <a id="ids-and-other-documents">IDs and Other Documents</a> (How to Obtain, Replace, Secure)

Often, agencies and programs will ask you for certain documents, like a government identification card (such as a driver’s license), a social security card, or a birth certificate.
If you have lost such documents, or never obtained them, this can be an obstacle to working with those agencies and programs.

This section of the guide shows you how to obtain or replace documents like these.

**In this section:**

- [Social Security Numbers or Cards](#social-security-numbers-or-cards)
- [ID Cards and Driver’s Licenses](#id-cards-drivers-licenses)
- [Birth, Death, and Marriage Certificates](#birth-death-marriage-certificates)
- [Civil Case Documents](#civil-case-documents)
- [Passports](#passports)
- [Tips](#document-tips)

### <a id="social-security-numbers-or-cards">Social Security Numbers or Cards</a>

You do not often need your social security *card*, but you do often need your social security *number*. <!-- Source: https://www.ssa.gov/number-card/replace-card -->
The [**Social Security Administration**](Directory.md#Social-Security-Administration) can help you get a new Social Security card. <!-- Source: https://www.ssa.gov/number-card/replace-card -->

If you have an account or can create an account at [ssa.gov/myaccount](https://www.ssa.gov/myaccount), you can request a Social Security card online and they will mail it to you. <!-- Source: https://www.ssa.gov/number-card/replace-card/get-started/apply-online -->
You can get help with this process by calling [800-772-1213](tel:+1-800-772-1213) (TTY: [800-325-0778](tel:+1-800-325-0778)). <!-- Source: https://www.ssa.gov/number-card/replace-card -->

> See [Mail Drops, Post Office Boxes, Etc.](#mail-drops-post-office-boxes) for ways to get mail if you do not have a stable mailing address.

If you are unable to complete this online process, you can visit the local Social Security Administration office to get a new card. <!-- Source: https://www.ssa.gov/number-card/replace-card/get-started/apply-online -->
It will go more smoothly if you can bring some alternative form of identification like a driver’s license, passport, Medicaid card, military ID, or certificate of naturalization. <!-- Source: https://www.ssa.gov/number-card/replace-card/get-started/apply-online -->

### <a id="id-cards-drivers-licenses">ID Cards and Driver’s Licenses</a>

A state-issued “Real ID,” or a California driver’s license which is also a Real ID, is a useful form of government-issued photo identification card that is widely accepted by a variety of programs, businesses, and service providers. <!-- Source: https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/driver-licenses-identification-cards/real-id/what-is-real-id/ -->
You get such an identification card from the [**California DMV**](Directory.md#California-DMV).

You typically first need to already have another identification document (such as a certified birth certificate, a passport, a permanent resident card, a certificate of naturalization or citizenship, or a permanent resident card) as well as documents that demonstrate your California residency (such as a utility bill, tax return, bank statement, or rental agreement that contains your name and address). <!-- Source: https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/driver-licenses-identification-cards/real-id/real-id-checklist/ and https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/driver-licenses-identification-cards/real-id/real-id-checklist/#gf_6 -->
You can complete an application online, but you must then visit the California DMV office to have your photo taken and to show your documents. <!-- Source: https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/driver-licenses-identification-cards/real-id/ -->

There are also fees you typically must pay to obtain either a Real ID or a driver’s license that operates as a Real ID. <!-- Source: https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/driver-licenses-identification-cards/identification-id-cards/ -->
However, if you are homeless, you may be able to get a waiver for fees (a “no-fee ID card”), and you may be able to use the address of a homeless shelter or other homeless services agency as your California residency address. <!-- Source: https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/driver-licenses-identification-cards/identification-id-cards/ -->
This is true even if you are only temporarily homeless because you are fleeing domestic violence or a similar dangerous situation. <!-- Source: https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/driver-licenses-identification-cards/identification-id-cards/ -->
You can only get a simple Real ID (“California Identification Card”) with the no-fee method, not a driver’s license. <!-- SOURCE NEEDED -->
Homeless services providers like [**40 Prado Homeless Services Center**](Directory.md#40-Prado), the [**5Cities Homeless Coalition (5CHC)**](Directory.md#5CHC), or the [**El Camino Homeless Organization (ECHO)**](Directory.md#ECHO) can help you with this process. <!-- SOURCE NEEDED -->

If you have previously received a Real ID or California driver’s license, but you have lost the card and need to replace it, you can begin this process by visiting [dmv.ca.gov: “Driver’s License or ID Card Replacement”](https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/driver-licenses-identification-cards/replace-your-driver-license-or-identification-dl-id-card/) or the California DMV office.

### <a id="birth-death-marriage-certificates">Birth, Death, and Marriage Certificates</a>

If you were born in SLO County, you can obtain a copy of your birth certificate from the [**SLO County Clerk-Recorder**](Directory.md#SLO-County-Clerk-Recorder). <!-- Source: https://www.slocounty.ca.gov/departments/clerk-recorder/all-services/vital-records-(births,-deaths,-marriages)/birth-certificates -->
You will need to show valid identification (typically, a government-issued photo ID like a driver’s license or passport). <!-- Source: https://www.slocounty.ca.gov/departments/clerk-recorder/all-services/vital-records-(births,-deaths,-marriages)/birth-certificates -->

There is also a $32 fee. <!-- Source: https://www.slocounty.ca.gov/departments/clerk-recorder/forms-documents/fees/fee-schedule-effective-1-1-2024 -->
However, if you are homeless, you can request an “Affidavit of Homeless Status for Fee Exempt Certified Copy of Birth Certificate.” <!-- Source: https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CHSI/Pages/Assembly-Bill-(AB)-1733.aspx -->
You need to sign this and you also need to get a signature from a “homeless services provider.” <!-- SOURCE NEEDED -->
This exempts you from having to pay the $32 fee. <!-- Source: https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CHSI/Pages/Assembly-Bill-(AB)-1733.aspx -->
Homeless services providers like [**40 Prado Homeless Services Center**](Directory.md#40-Prado), the [**5Cities Homeless Coalition (5CHC)**](Directory.md#5CHC), or the [**El Camino Homeless Organization (ECHO)**](Directory.md#ECHO) can help you with this process. <!-- SOURCE NEEDED -->

You can obtain a “certified copy” of a birth certificate for yourself or your child or other close relative. <!-- Source: https://www.slocounty.ca.gov/departments/clerk-recorder/all-services/vital-records-(births,-deaths,-marriages)/birth-certificates -->
A certified copy allows you to establish your identity. <!-- SOURCE NEEDED -->
Otherwise you can obtain an “informational” copy, which is not valid for establishing identity. <!-- Source: https://www.slocounty.ca.gov/departments/clerk-recorder/all-services/vital-records-(births,-deaths,-marriages)/birth-certificates -->
Try to learn ahead of time whether you need a certified copy, and, if so, ask for one specifically when you order your copy.

You can also use the [VitalChek](https://www.vitalchek.com/v/vital-records/california/san-luis-obispo-county-recorder) website to order an *informational* copy of your birth certificate online without visiting the SLO County Clerk-Recorder office.
(You may need to provide a notarized, sworn statement if you want to order a “certified copy” this way, in which case it is probably just as easy to visit the SLO County Clerk-Recorder office.)
That may cost a bit more.

Death records for deaths that occurred in SLO County can also be obtained from the SLO County Clerk-Recorder ($24) or from VitalChek. <!-- Sources: https://www.slocounty.ca.gov/departments/clerk-recorder/all-services/vital-records-(births,-deaths,-marriages)/death-certificates and https://www.slocounty.ca.gov/departments/clerk-recorder/forms-documents/fees/fee-schedule-effective-1-1-2024 -->
Again, there is a difference between “certified” and “informational” copies of death certificates, and you should check which one you need before you order it. <!-- Source: https://www.slocounty.ca.gov/departments/clerk-recorder/all-services/vital-records-(births,-deaths,-marriages)/death-certificates -->
You can typically only get a “certified” copy for a close relative, and you may have to provide additional documentation. <!-- Source: https://www.slocounty.ca.gov/departments/clerk-recorder/all-services/vital-records-(births,-deaths,-marriages)/death-certificates -->

You can also get a copy of a marriage certificate that was issued in SLO County from the SLO County Clerk-Recorder office ($17) or from VitalChek. <!-- Sources: https://www.slocounty.ca.gov/departments/clerk-recorder/all-services/vital-records-(births,-deaths,-marriages)/marriage-certificates and https://www.slocounty.ca.gov/departments/clerk-recorder/forms-documents/fees/fee-schedule-effective-1-1-2024 -->
Again, there is a difference between “certified” and “informational” copies, and you should check which one you need before you order it. <!-- Source: https://www.slocounty.ca.gov/departments/clerk-recorder/all-services/vital-records-(births,-deaths,-marriages)/marriage-certificates -->
You can typically only get a “certified” copy for yourself or a close relative, and you may have to provide additional documentation. <!-- Source: https://www.slocounty.ca.gov/departments/clerk-recorder/all-services/vital-records-(births,-deaths,-marriages)/marriage-certificates -->

There is no homeless fee exemption program for death and marriage certificates the way there is for birth certificates.

If you need a birth, death, or marriage certificate from another county in California, try the [California Department of Public Health’s “Vital Records”](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CHSI/Pages/Vital-Records.aspx) web page.
If you need such records from elsewhere in the U.S. outside California, visit the [National Center for Health Statistics](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/w2w/index.htm) web page.
The VitalChek website can often also get you these records from other areas.

### <a id="civil-case-documents">Civil Case Documents</a>

To get copies of [**SLO Superior Court**](Directory.md#SLO-Superior-Court) documents in civil cases to which you are a party, first go to the court offices in San Luis Obispo or in Paso Robles.
Those offices have a publicly-accessible computer at which you can find your case number.
Court staff can help you with this process.
Then review the documents associated with that case, choose which documents you want, and request them.
You must pay 50¢ per page to get printouts of these documents.

If you cannot go to the court offices, you can follow the procedure described on [this web page](https://www.slo.courts.ca.gov/self-help/civil-appeals/getting-copies-court-files) to order documents by mail.

If you have a lawyer, that lawyer may be able to search for these documents online themselves.

> See the [Legal Help & Crime Victim Protection](#legal-help) section for some tips on getting help from a lawyer.

### <a id="passports">Passports</a>

You need a passport to travel by air, land, or sea to most international destinations.

#### <a id="first-time-passport">Getting a Passport for the First Time</a>

If you cannot renew by mail (for example, if your passport is lost, stolen, damaged, or expired more than five years), you must apply in person using the same process as for a first-time passport. <!-- Source: https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/need-passport/apply-in-person.html -->

#### Replacing a Lost or Stolen Passport

If your passport is lost or stolen, follow these steps to get a new one:

1. **Report it immediately:**
  Report your passport lost or stolen as soon as possible. <!-- Source: https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/have-passport/lost-stolen.html -->
  This protects you from identity theft. <!-- Source: https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/have-passport/lost-stolen.html -->
  You can report [online using Form DS-64](https://pptform.state.gov/), by calling [877-487-2778](tel:+1-877-487-2778) (TTY [888-874-7793](tel:+1-888-874-7793)), or in person when you apply for a replacement. <!-- SOURCE NEEDED (https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/have-passport/lost-stolen.html does not include phone as option here) -->
  Note that if you report your passport lost or stolen, you can no longer use it for travel even if you find it later. <!-- Source: https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/have-passport/lost-stolen.html -->

1. **Apply for a replacement:**
  To replace a lost or stolen passport, apply in person at an authorized passport acceptance facility.
  The process and requirements are the same as for a first-time passport application ([see above](#first-time-passport)). <!-- SOURCE NEEDED -->
  Reporting your passport lost or stolen does not replace it; to get a replacement you must also apply for a new passport.
  This costs $165.

#### Passports from Other Countries

If you are a citizen of another country and you need to obtain or renew a passport from your home country, contact your country’s embassy or consulate.
The nearest consulates for many countries are located in Los Angeles or San Francisco.
You can find contact information for embassies and consulates at [embassy.goabroad.com](https://embassy.goabroad.com/) or by searching online for your country’s embassy or consulate in the United States.

### <a id="document-tips">Tips</a>

#### Document Storage and Security

Here are some tips for handling important documents:

- Use your phone camera to take photos of important documents, and save those photos “in the cloud” (iCloud for iPhone, Google Photos for Android) so still have access to your photos if your phone is lost or stolen.
- Make copies of important documents, and store the copies separately from the originals.
  That way if you lose one set, you are less likely to lose all of them.
- Some homeless services centers offer document storage for their clients.
  Ask your case worker if they can store your important documents in your file at those agencies.
- If you have enough money, consider storing especially important or difficult-to-replace documents in a safety deposit box at a bank.
  These can be rented for $30–50 per year. <!-- SOURCE NEEDED -->

#### If You Have No Identification Documents

If you are completely without identifying documentation, you may need help establishing your identity so that you can access programs and services that require you to show them identification.

You may want to begin by contacting the [**Social Security Administration**](Directory.md#Social-Security-Administration) who can assist you in verifying your identity through their records. <!-- SOURCE NEEDED -->

[**SLO Court Self-Help Services**](Directory.md#SLO-Court-Self-Help-Services) can help you through California’s affidavit processes, with which you can establish your identity when you lack identity documentation. <!-- SOURCE NEEDED -->
This way you can get a California photo ID card, which helps you get access to many programs and services. <!-- SOURCE NEEDED -->
There is an expensive filing fee for this process, but ask about a fee waiver that is available to people with low incomes. <!-- SOURCE NEEDED -->

If you have a case manager, ask them if they can help you with this process.

## <a id="mail-drops-post-office-boxes">Mail Drops, Post Office Boxes, Etc.</a>

If you are homeless, you may be at a loss when asked for your mailing address.
There are various ways to establish a reliable mailing address even if you do not have a stable living address.

The [**5Cities Homeless Coalition**](Directory.md#5CHC) <!-- Source: https://5chc.org/programs/information-and-referral-coordinated-entry -->
and [**40 Prado Homeless Services Center**](Directory.md#40-Prado) <!-- SOURCE NEEDED -->
offices permit clients of their services to use these offices as mailing addresses, and will hold your incoming mail there for you.
Ask them for details.

You can rent mail boxes from UPS Stores and from the U.S. Postal Service.
The Postal Service option is more affordable.
But sometimes, a “P.O. Box” address (what you get from the Postal Service) is not adequate for your needs.
One advantage of the UPS Store option is that it appears as a regular street address (e.g. “1241 Johnson Avenue #1234, San Luis Obispo”). <!-- Source: https://www.theupsstore.com/mailboxes/personal-mailboxes -->
UPS Store locations with mailbox rental services are available throughout SLO County: <!-- Source: https://www.theupsstore.com/tools/find-a-store -->

**Note**: In cities with multiple post office locations, General Delivery is typically handled at only one facility (usually the main post office). <!-- Source: https://faq.usps.com/s/article/What-is-General-Delivery -->
For example, San Luis Obispo has two post offices, but General Delivery is handled at the main location on Dalidio Dr. <!-- SOURCE NEEDED -->
To confirm which location handles General Delivery in your area, call [800-275-8777](tel:+1-800-275-8777) and request “Customer Service,” or use the [USPS ZIP Code lookup tool](https://tools.usps.com/zip-code-lookup.htm) by entering “General Delivery” as the address line.

You should speak with the postmaster at the post office where you want to receive general delivery mail beforehand. <!-- SOURCE NEEDED -->
The post office will hold general delivery mail for you for at least 10 days. <!-- Source: https://faq.usps.com/s/article/What-is-General-Delivery -->
You must have a valid photo ID to collect your mail at the post office. <!-- SOURCE NEEDED -->
This service is free. <!-- Source: https://faq.usps.com/s/article/What-is-General-Delivery -->
However, this is not a long-term solution; it is meant for temporary use (for instance by travelers passing through town). <!-- SOURCE NEEDED -->
The post office may stop accepting general delivery mail for you if you try to use this method for a long time or if you get too much mail. <!-- SOurce: https://faq.usps.com/s/article/What-is-General-Delivery -->

### <a id="banks-and-credit-unions">Banks and Credit Unions</a>

Credit unions are like banks, but are nonprofit organizations that tend to be locally-focused.
They can often be more accommodating than banks to people with low incomes and to homeless people. <!-- SOURCE NEEDED -->

Credit unions in SLO County include:

- [**CoastHills Credit Union**](Directory.md#CoastHills-Credit-Union)
- [**Golden 1 Credit Union**](Directory.md#Golden-1-Credit-Union)
- [**SESLOC Credit Union**](Directory.md#SESLOC-Credit-Union)
- [**SLO Credit Union**](Directory.md#SLO-Credit-Union)

Some ordinary banks offer “Bank On Certified Accounts” which are savings or checking accounts that are more affordable, have small minimum balances, and have no overdraft fees. <!-- Source: https://joinbankon.org/about/ -->
You can search for banks that offer such accounts at [joinbankon.org](https://joinbankon.org/accounts/).

> See the [Mail Drops, Post Office Boxes, Etc.](#mail-drops-post-office-boxes) section of this guide if you do not have a stable address and you need an address you can use while establishing a bank account.

> See the [IDs and other documents](#ids-and-other-documents) section of this guide for information on how to obtain required identification and other documentation.

**Tips for how to succeed in establishing a bank account:**

- Call ahead: Contact banks before you visit and ask about their specific requirements
- Bring multiple documents: Have as much identification and address verification as possible
- Learn about special programs: Ask about programs for people without permanent addresses
- Consider credit unions first: They are often more flexible and community-focused than large banks
- Use service organization support: Have case workers or service providers help advocate and provide verification if needed

## <a id="tax-preparation">Tax Preparation</a>

There are several programs that can give you free assistance in completing and filing your annual tax returns.
Free tax assistance programs are usually available in the February-through-April period. <!-- Source: https://unitedwayslo.org/family-financial-stability/taxes/ -->

Even if you do not think you owe any taxes because your income is very low, it can be to your advantage to file a tax return.
This is for a few reasons:

1. You may qualify for certain refundable tax credits that can put money in your pocket, even if you did not pay taxes all year. <!-- Source: https://www.irs.gov/credits-deductions/individuals/refundable-tax-credits -->
1. Some programs for low-income people require those people to show their most recent tax return to prove that they qualify.
1. Filing a tax return, even if it is of no practical effect, can be a gesture of compliance with the law that can be helpful, for example if you are engaged in the U.S. immigration process. <!-- SOURCE NEEDED -->

Avoid using commercial tax preparers that charge high fees, or that offer refund anticipation loans (so-called “instant” refunds). <!-- Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refund_anticipation_loan -->
Some of these preparers give poor-quality tax advice, and most of them are bad bargains compared to the free services.

If you are due a tax refund, you will get that refund more quickly if you have a bank account that accepts direct deposit.
The U.S. Internal Revenue Service stopped issuing paper tax refund checks in 2025. <!-- Source: https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-to-phase-out-paper-tax-refund-checks-starting-with-individual-taxpayerspreparers -->

> See the [Banking and Money Management](#banking-and-money-management) section of this guide for help in establishing a bank account.

The national Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) program allows low- and moderate-income people to get free help in preparing and filing their federal and state tax returns.
Various organizations, including Cal Poly, Allan Hancock college, and [**AARP**](Directory.md#AARP-Tax-Aide), offer this program.
<!-- Note: United Way has dropped out of this program in 2025 https://unitedwayslo.org/family-financial-stability/taxes/ -->
Use United Way’s [211](tel:+1-211) service to find a VITA location near you and make an appointment.
The United Way also has [an online program](https://www.myfreetaxes.org/file-with-virtual-help/) with which you can upload your tax documents and get free help from tax preparation volunteers over the internet.

There are also free options that allow you to file your federal income taxes yourself by using guided tax preparation software or by filling in online forms and filing them electronically.
See [irs.gov/freefile](https://www.irs.gov/freefile) for details.
<!-- Note: IRS “Direct File” is kaput as of tax year 2025 -->

> See the [Internet Access / Email / Digital Access Assistance](#internet-and-email) section of this guide for ways to get access to a computer and the internet.

Homeless people can use the address of a friend, relative, or trusted service provider as their filing address. <!-- SOURCE NEEDED -->

## <a id="navigating-social-security">Navigating Social Security / SSDI / SSI / Survivors Benefits / CAPI</a>

> See the [Social Security Numbers or Cards](#social-security-numbers-or-cards) section of this guide to learn how to get a Social Security number or to get or replace a Social Security card.

Note: in 2025, Social Security stopped issuing paper checks. <!-- Source: https://blog.ssa.gov/social-security-to-fully-transition-to-electronic-payments/ -->
Now they use direct deposit to bank accounts or issue a “Direct Express” prepaid debit card. <!-- Source: https://blog.ssa.gov/social-security-to-fully-transition-to-electronic-payments/ -->

> See the [Banks and Credit Unions](#banks-and-credit-unions) section of this guide for information on how to establish a bank account.

There are a number of programs operated by the Social Security Administration, including:

- **Social Security** — monthly payments from the government to people who reach retirement age, and who paid into the social security system while they were working
- **Social Security Disability Insurance** (SSDI) — monthly payments from the government to people who cannot work because they are disabled, and who paid into the social security system while they were working
- **Supplemental Security Income** (SSI) — monthly payments from the government to disabled people and to seniors with limited means

Homeless people have the same rights as anyone else to apply for these payments. <!-- SOURCE NEEDED -->
You do not have to have a permanent address to receive benefits. <!-- SOURCE NEEDED -->

You may be entitled to certain benefits even if you did not pay into the social security system, if your spouse or ex-spouse did.
You may need to appear at the Social Security Administration office in person to apply for such spousal or survivors benefits. <!-- SOURCE NEEDED -->

> See the [Mail drops](#mail-drops-post-office-boxes) section of this guide for information on establishing a mailing address.

You can apply for these benefits through the local [**Social Security Administration**](Directory.md#Social-Security-Administration) office either in person or by phone.
You can also [apply online](https://www.ssa.gov/apply) at the Social Security Administration’s website.
If you have a case worker, ask them if they can help you through the process or refer you to someone who can.

To make the application process go smoothly, learn what documentation you need and have that documentation with you when you apply.
If you do not have a stable mailing address, establish one ahead of time.
If you are applying for disability, bring your relevant medical records, treatment history, and medical provider contact information.
Pay stubs and tax records can help to establish your work history, especially if you were paid under-the-table or as a contractor rather than an employee.

Be patient, as the process of applying for benefits can be time-consuming and the bureaucracy can move slowly.
If you are denied benefits, learn about the appeals process and consider appealing the decision.

If you are denied SSI benefits solely because of your immigration status, you may be able to get benefits instead from the [California Assistance Program for Immigrants (CAPI)](https://www.slocounty.ca.gov/departments/social-services/cash-assistance-programs/services/california-assistance-program-for-immigrants-%28capi).
Apply to the [**SLO County Department of Social Services**](Directory.md#SLO-County-Department-of-Social-Services) by phone, in person, by mail, or by email. <!-- Source: https://www.slocounty.ca.gov/departments/social-services/cash-assistance-programs/services/california-assistance-program-for-immigrants-%28capi -->

If you have a disability and are applying for Social Security Disability Insurance, you may be able to get some immediate financial help from the [**SLO County Department of Social Services**](Directory.md#SLO-County-Department-of-Social-Services)’ “General Assistance Disabled Program” while you wait for your application to be processed. <!-- Source: https://www.slocounty.ca.gov/departments/social-services/cash-assistance-programs/services/general-assistance-cash-aid -->

### <a id="gig-jobs">Making Ends Meet: Gig Jobs</a>

There are some ways to earn small amounts of money by doing various tasks on the internet, such as taking surveys, watching videos, or testing apps.
Some of these are scams, and most do not pay very much, but they can be ways to make a few bucks here and there if you are unable to find or commit to steady work.

The [“beermoney” subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/) maintains [a curated list of such opportunities](https://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/ab0dyv/most_common_beer_money_sites_do_not_create/).
That site also includes feedback from participants on their experiences.

The site [FlexJobs](https://www.flexjobs.com/) is another way to find remote jobs with flexible hours.

#### Educational Continuity (McKinney-Vento Act)

Federal law (the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act) protects homeless students in elementary through high school in several ways: <!-- Source: https://nche.ed.gov/legislation/mckinney-vento/ -->

1. You have the right to enroll in school even if you currently lack documents such as proof of residency, immunization records, or birth certificates.
1. You have the right to attend the same school you were enrolled in when you were last housed, even if you have since lost your home.
1. You have the right to transportation to and from school.
1. You have the right to the same educational services as non-homeless students.
1. If you are an unaccompanied homeless youth, you have the right to enroll in school without the consent of your parent or guardian.

Homelessness, as the McKinney-Vento Act defines it, also includes situations when you are couch surfing, living in a motel or campground, living in a vehicle, living in a shelter, or squatting in an abandoned building. <!-- Source: https://nche.ed.gov/mckinney-vento-definition/ -->

Every school district has a McKinney-Vento liaison whom you can go to if you need help defending these rights.
You can find [a list of these liaisons and their contact information](https://www.slocoe.org/about/programs/homeless-and-foster-youth-services-coordinating-program/school-district-liaisons-and-contacts/) at the SLO County Office of Education website.

The SLO County Office of Education’s [“Homeless and Foster Youth Services Coordinating Program”](https://www.slocoe.org/about/programs/homeless-and-foster-youth-services-coordinating-program/) can help homeless and foster youth manage their enrollment in school, including choosing which school to attend, getting their records transferred from previous schools, and finding resources that will be useful to them.
To access this program, contact the McKinney-Vento liaison for your school district or contact the County Office of Education at [805-782-7268](tel:+1-805-782-7268) or [jthomas@slocoe.org](mailto:jthomas@slocoe.org).

### <a id="fire-safety">Fire Safety in Camp</a>

If you are camping outdoors, be very careful with fire.
California frequently experiences major wildfires, and campfires are a frequent cause.

Build fires at least 25 feet away from tents, shrubs, and flammable materials.
Do not build fires under overhanging tree branches.
Avoid fires on windy days and during periods when fire danger is particularly high (such as mid to late Summer).
Do not use flammable liquids like gasoline or lighter fluid to start camp fires.

Keep fires small.
It is wiser and takes less effort to make a small fire and sit close to it than to make a big fire and sit far away.

Use existing fire rings when these are available.
Otherwise clear a five-foot (two-meter) radius around the fire of all vegetation and flammable material.

Have a bucket of water handy.

Do not leave a fire unattended.
Always extinguish it thoroughly first.
To extinguish a fire thoroughly, soak it with water.
Stir the ashes to expose any unburned material, and soak it again.
The fire is not thoroughly extinguished until you can place your hand anywhere into the ashes without getting burned.

Note that in California it is not legal to have a campfire outside of a developed campground unless you have a valid [California Campfire Permit](https://www.ca.gov/departments/147/services/1239/). <!-- Source: https://www.law.cornell.edu/regulations/california/14-CCR-1402 -->
In many times and places in SLO County it is not legal to make a campfire whether you have such a permit or not. <!-- SOURCE NEEDED -->

### <a id="extreme-cold-and-heat">Extreme Cold and Heat</a>

SLO County is in general blessed with a moderate climate, but rainy or dangerously cold overnight weather is common in Winter, and dangerously hot daytime weather is common in Summer.
See the [Warming/Cooling Centers](#warming-cooling-centers) of this guide for some ways to get shelter from these temperature extremes.
Warming centers typically open when temperatures are due to drop to 38°F or below or there is more than a 50% chance of rain.

San Luis Obispo County is an especially challenging place for people trying to avoid or to escape homelessness.
Nearly one in four homeless people in the United States lives in California. <!-- Source: "2024 AHAR: Part 1 - PIT Estimates of Homelessness in the U.S." United States Department of Housing and Urban Development. December 2024. -->
California has one of the highest per-capita rates of homelessness in the nation, and the highest percentage of unsheltered homeless people. <!-- Source: "2024 AHAR: Part 1 - PIT Estimates of Homelessness in the U.S." United States Department of Housing and Urban Development. December 2024. -->
In San Luis Obispo County, there are only enough shelter beds for about 20–30% of the people known to be homeless here, and so the county has the third highest percentage of *unsheltered* homelessness of any mostly-rural county in the U.S. <!-- Source: "The San Luis Obispo Countywide Plan to Address Homelessness 2022–2027", July 20, 2022, p. 5 -->
The city of San Luis Obispo is one of the top ten most expensive cities in the U.S. based on how much income (relative to the median income) you must have to afford to buy a home. <!-- Source: Shibley, Emma K. (June 17, 2025), The income needed to buy a home in major U.S. cities, Consumer Affairs (Journal of Consumer Research) -->
11.7% of schoolchildren in SLO County are homeless, which is more than double the rate of the state as a whole. <!-- Source: https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/DQCensus/HmlsEnrByDTLevels.aspx?cds=00&agglevel=State&year=2024-25 -->

Why are things especially difficult here?
There are many reasons, but the most important one is “too few homes for the number of people who need them.” <!-- Source: Streeter, Jialu L. (May 2022). "Homelessness in California: Causes and policy considerations". Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research Policy Brief. -->
The reasons why that is a problem are complicated, but include government policies that reduce the availability of homes and make them more expensive, resource constraints, and high demand.

### <a id="influencing-policy">Influencing Policy</a>

The [SLO County Homeless Services Division](https://www.slocounty.ca.gov/departments/social-services/homeless-services-division) is in charge of implementing County policies to address homelessness.
These policies include [*The San Luis Obispo Countywide Plan to Address Homelessness, 2022–2027*](https://www.slocounty.ca.gov/departments/social-services/homeless-services-division/homeless-services-oversight-council/forms-documents/2022/slocountywideplantoaddresshomelessness).
You can contact them at [SS_HomelessServices@co.slo.ca.us](mailto:SS_HomelessServices@co.slo.ca.us).

The Homeless Services Division is advised and overseen by the [Homeless Services Oversight Council (HSOC)](https://www.slocounty.ca.gov/departments/social-services/homeless-services-division/homeless-services-oversight-council).
This council welcomes people with current or past lived experience of homelessness to join it. <!-- Source: https://www.slocounty.ca.gov/departments/social-services/homeless-services-division/homeless-services-oversight-council/hsoc-membership -->
You can apply for a seat on this council by completing [this form](https://www.slocounty.ca.gov/departments/social-services/homeless-services-division/homeless-services-oversight-council/hsoc-membership/forms-documents/2024/hsoc-membership-application-form) and submitting it to [SS_HomelessServices@co.slo.ca.us](mailto:SS_HomelessServices@co.slo.ca.us).

The meetings of this council and its committees are open to the public, either in person, or via Zoom or phone. <!-- e.g. https://www.slocounty.ca.gov/departments/social-services/homeless-services-division/homeless-services-oversight-council/full-hsoc/meetings/2025/11-19-2025-full-hsoc-meeting ; also HSOC is a Brown Act agency and its meetings must be open to the public -->
Visit [slocounty.gov/HSOC](https://www.slocounty.ca.gov/departments/social-services/homeless-services-division/homeless-services-oversight-council) for meeting schedules.

Every two years, typically in January, a census of homeless people in the United States is attempted.
This is called the [“Point-in-Time Count”](https://www.slocounty.ca.gov/departments/social-services/homeless-services-division/point-in-time-count).
This helps the government estimate how many people are homeless, where homeless people are, and what their characteristics are.
This in turn helps the government decide what policy responses to prioritize.
You can read [the official report on SLO County’s 2024 Point-in-Time Count](https://www.slocounty.ca.gov/getmedia/3eb220e5-a230-4c31-9a87-e2bc24e648be/2024_pitcount_communityreport).
The Point-in-Time Count is conducted in part by volunteers. <!-- Source: https://www.slocounty.ca.gov/departments/social-services/homeless-services-division/point-in-time-count -->
If you would like to help with the Count, email [HSD_PITCount@co.slo.ca.us](mailto:HSD_PITCount@co.slo.ca.us) or register at the [2026 Point-in-Time Count Volunteer Registration](https://forms.office.com/g/8vJ7PUm8yA) page.

[SLOCo YIMBY](https://www.slocoyimby.org/) is a grassroots group that advocates for building more housing in SLO County, and for policy changes like legalizing multifamily housing, streamlining permitting, increasing affordable housing funding, and strengthening renter protections.
They mobilize citizen action and outreach campaigns in support of those goals.
Contact [hello@slocoyimby.org](mailto:hello@slocoyimby.org) for details.

The [National Coalition for the Homeless](https://nationalhomeless.org/) campaigns on the national level for changes in U.S. federal policy to alleviate homelessness and help people who are homeless.

The [National Union of the Homeless](https://nationalunionofthehomeless.org/) has a [Sacramento chapter](https://sacramentohomelessunion.org/) that helped SLO County homeless people fight for legal protection when the Kansas Avenue (a.k.a. Oklahoma Avenue) safe parking program was closed.
You can contact the Sacramento chapter at [sacramento.homeless.union@gmail.com](mailto:sacramento.homeless.union@gmail.com).

### <a id="reporting-misconduct">Reporting Government Misconduct</a>

You can report misconduct by police or sheriff personnel to the police or sheriff departments.
Some departments welcome such reports and use them to improve or to discipline misbehaving employees.
Other departments are hostile to such complaints and may even retaliate against people who report misconduct.
You may want to carefully consider the pros and cons before filing misconduct complaints.
