# Surviving Homelessness in SLO

This guide helps you find free and low-cost resources that can help you if you are experiencing homelessness, are threatened with homelessness, or are just short on money.
It is specific to San Luis Obispo County.

The guide is organized into pages by topics like “Shelter and housing” or “Food”.
Each page briefly describes resources available in San Luis Obispo County.
Many of these resources contain boldface links to our [Directory](Directory.md).
This Directory page lists resources in alphabetical order, along with information like the website, phone number, email address, location, and operating hours of the resource.
If you find a resource in the guide that seems it will be useful to you, click the boldface link to go to the directory and find out how to access that resource.

San Luis Obispo County is an especially challenging place for people trying to avoid or to escape homelessness.
Nearly one in four homeless people in the United States lives in California.
California has one of the highest per-capita rates of homelessness in the nation, and the highest percentage of unsheltered homeless people.
(In San Luis Obispo County, there are only enough shelter beds for about 20–30% of the people known to be homeless here, meaning that the county has the third highest percentage of unsheltered homelessness in the U.S.)
The city of San Luis Obispo is one of top ten most expensive cities in the U.S. based on how much income (relative to the median income) you must have in order to afford to buy a home.
10% of schoolchildren in SLO County are homeless.

Why are things especially difficult here?
There are many reasons, but the most important ones can be summed up by “too few homes for the number of people who need them.”
The reasons why that is a problem are complicated, but include government policies that discourage homebuilding and make it more expensive, and resource constraints.

Fortunately, there is a lot of help available to people experiencing or threatened with homelessnes in SLO County.
Unfortunately, it can be difficult to discover this help or to understand how to access it.
We hope this guide will make it easier.

This guide was developed by volunteers from [**Shower the People**](Directory.md#Shower-the-People).

## <a id="tips-on-self-advocacy-and-for-communicating-with-service-providers">**Tips on self-advocacy and for communicating with service providers**</a>

1. **Building Effective Relationships with Case Managers and Service Providers**
   - **Be prepared for appointments**
      - **Bring documentation**: ID, any paperwork related to your situation, and a list of questions or needs
      - **Be on time**: Arrive early when possible; call if you'll be late
      - **Keep records**: Maintain a simple notebook or phone notes of appointments, contacts, and commitments made
   - **Communication strategies**
      - **Be honest and direct**: Clearly explain your situation, needs, and any barriers you're facing
      - **Ask questions**: Don't hesitate to ask for clarification about programs, requirements, or next steps
      - **Express appreciation**: Acknowledge when providers are helpful—positive relationships benefit everyone
      - **Follow up**: Check back on promised actions or referrals if you don't hear back within reasonable time
1. **Self-Advocacy Fundamentals**
   - **Know your rights**
      - **Fair treatment**: Many service providers have non-discrimination policies and strive for respectful treatment, though policies vary between agencies; some services may have specific eligibility restrictions (veterans-only, income limits, etc.)
      - **Privacy**: Privacy policies vary by agency; government agencies often share information through HMIS (Homeless Management Information System); you'll receive privacy notices before data entry and can ask to review them later; some data may be required for services while other information can be withheld—ask about Release of Information (ROI) forms and their implications before signing
      - **Appeal processes**: Many programs have procedures for appealing decisions or filing complaints—ask program staff or search online to find the specific process; legal aid organizations can help with appeals (see [Legal assistance](#legal-help--mediation-crime-victim-protection) section)
   - **Document everything**
      - **Keep copies**: Keep copies of important documents and applications
      - **Protect against theft/loss**: Store documents in waterproof bags, use your backpack as a pillow when sleeping, keep most important items in body pockets (money in bra/tight coin pocket), consider safety deposit box if you have income
      - **Take photos**: Use your phone to photograph important paperwork; enable automatic cloud backup (iCloud for iPhone, Google Photos for Android) so photos survive if phone is lost/stolen
      - **Cloud storage notes**: iPhones come with 5GB free iCloud storage, Android phones get 15GB free Google storage; turn on automatic backup in Settings to protect document photos
      - **Record interactions**: Note dates, names, and outcomes of important conversations
      - **Reference numbers**: Keep case numbers, application numbers, and confirmation numbers
1. **Strengths-Based Self-Advocacy**
   - **Focus on your goals**: Clearly communicate what you're working toward (housing, employment, healthcare, etc.)
   - **Highlight relevant assets**: Share skills, experience, education, and personal strengths when relevant to services sought (e.g., work experience for employment services, but not necessarily for basic needs like clothing or food)
   - **Be imaginative and solution-oriented**: Come to meetings with ideas about what might work for your situation
   - **Take initiative**: Follow through on commitments and take active steps toward your goals
1. **Navigating System Barriers**
   - **Understand program requirements**: Learn eligibility criteria, deadlines, and required steps for programs
   - **Ask about alternatives**: If you don't qualify for one program, ask about other options
   - **Request accommodations**: If you have disabilities or special needs, ask about available accommodations
   - **Escalate when necessary**: If you're not getting help, ask to speak with supervisors, use formal complaint procedures and appeal processes, or find someone who knows the system well to help you navigate it more effectively (e.g. case manager, behavioral health navigator, legal aid, peer advocates)
1. **Working with Multiple Service Providers**
   - **Coordinate communications**: Let each provider know about other services you're receiving when relevant (e.g., tell housing programs about your income sources, but casual services like showers don't need to know about each other)
   - **Avoid application duplication**: If an agency plans to apply for a service in your name, tell them if you've already applied independently to prevent duplicate applications; keep track of which applications you've made or have been made on your behalf to avoid wasting time re-doing what's already been done
   - **Share information strategically**: Share information that's directly relevant to the services you're seeking (e.g., income for benefits applications, medical history for healthcare) while keeping unrelated personal details private
   - **Keep a contact list**: Maintain current contact information for all your service providers; ask for direct phone numbers or business cards from people familiar with your case to avoid navigating phone trees
1. **Motivational Interviewing and Goal Setting**
   - **Set SMART goals**: Make your goals Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound
   - **Break down big goals**: Divide major objectives (like housing) into smaller, manageable steps
   - **Celebrate progress**: Acknowledge your achievements, even small ones
   - **Adjust as needed**: Be flexible and willing to modify goals as circumstances change
1. **When Things Go Wrong**
   - **Stay calm and professional**: Even when frustrated, maintain respectful communication—this approach typically gets better results and faster resolution than confrontational approaches, though this may feel counterintuitive if you've learned to be assertive to protect yourself
   - **Document problems**: Record details about issues, including dates, names, and specific problems
   - **Don't give up too soon**: Persistence often pays off in navigating complex systems
1. **Resource Navigation Tips**
   - **Use 211**: Call 2-1-1 for comprehensive information about available services
   - **Network with peers**: Other people in similar situations often have valuable information and tips
   - **Stay informed**: Keep up with changes in programs, funding, and eligibility requirements; note that this guide reflects information available at publication time, which may change—always contact service providers directly to verify current information before traveling to locations
   - **Build relationships**: Maintain connections with especially helpful providers even when not actively using their services
1. **Managing Appointments and Commitments**
   - **Use reminders**: Set phone alarms or ask for reminder calls when available
   - **Plan transportation**: Ensure you have reliable transportation to appointments (see [Transportation](#transportation) section)
   - **Prepare for wait times**: Bring something to do and expect some delays in busy service settings
   - **Reschedule when necessary**: Call ahead if you need to change appointments rather than simply not showing up

### <a id="eviction-protection">Eviction Prevention</a>

If you are about to be evicted because you are unable to pay rent, or if you’ve had to move your family into a hotel, you can get immediate financial help from the [**CalWORKS Homeless Assistance Program**](Directory.md#CalWORKS) or the [**Housing Support Program (HSP)**](Directory.md#Housing-Support-Program).
For either of these options, you must first get a referral from the [**SLO County Department of Social Services**](Directory.md#SLO-County-Department-of-Social-Services).

[**5Cities Homeless Coalition (5CHC)**](Directory.md#5CHC) operates a [housing assistance program](https://5chc.org/programs/housing-assistance) that offers financial assistance for rent for people in danger of becoming homeless.
Contact 5CHC to arrange a confidential coordinated entry interview.

> See the [Legal Help, Mediation, and Crime Victim Protection](#legal-help--mediation-crime-victim-protection) section for options about preventing illegal evictions.

> See the [Acute Financial Needs](#acute-financial-needs) section for more possible ways to get short-term financial help in a crisis.

### <a id="warming-cooling-centers">Warming/Cooling Centers</a>

Warming centers open only during unusually cold or rainy weather. They offer overnight shelter beds.
Cooling centers open only during the day when the weather is unusually hot. They offer you an air-conditioned place where you can get out of the sun.
It can be difficult to know on any particular day whether or not these centers are open, so it is a good idea to call ahead.

The SLO city warming/cooling center is at the [**40 Prado Homeless Services Center**](Directory.md#40-Prado).
When it operates as a warming center, check in is between 7pm and 9pm, and you must leave by 6am.
When it operates as a cooling center, you must leave by 6pm.

Call 805-295-1501 to verify the center is open and to learn about free transportation options to the center.
The warming center offers a free hot meal.

### <a id="overnight-shelter">Overnight Shelter</a>

If you are unsheltered and need a place to sleep tonight, these are some options:

The [**40 Prado Homeless Services Center**](Directory.md#40-Prado) has a hundred overnight shelter beds.
Many are reserved for people who have previously registered with 40 Prado, but a limited number are available on a walk-in basis.
To get a bed, first come on-site and complete the intake process any day from 8am to 2pm.
Thereafter, on any day when you need an overnight shelter bed, check in from 4:30pm to 6pm to secure a bed or to be placed on the waiting list.
They also offer meals (breakfast, lunch, and dinner), showers, laundry, mail/phone services, an integrated medical clinic (primary and urgent care five days a week with an on-site pharmacy), recuperative care beds, and an animal kennel.
To use the shelter, you must be a county resident with ID, you must not be a P.C. 290 registered sex offender, and you must participate in case management.

The 40 Prado center is the only walk-in, overnight homeless shelter in SLO County.
The [**El Camino Homeless Organization (ECHO)**](Directory.md#ECHO) used to operate a shelter in the north county, but now only offers 90-day transitional housing there (see below).

There is a shelter in Santa Maria, the [**Good Samaritan Shelter**](Directory.md#Good-Samaritan-Shelter).
They offer 90-day emergency homeless shelter to people from the Santa Maria Valley area.
They also have laundry facilities, hot meals, substance use treatment, and mental health services.
Contact them between 8:30am and 5pm to set up an intake appointment.

If you are homeless because you are escaping dangerous circumstances of domestic violence or sexual assault, you can get safe, confidential, emergency shelter at safe houses operated by [**Lumina Alliance**](Directory.md#Lumina-Alliance).
They will also help you with trained advocacy, accompaniment to medical/legal appointments, case management, and therapy for survivors and children.
They operate throughout SLO County, and are open to people of all genders, ages, and backgrounds.

If you are homeless and have a medically verified need for 24/7 temporary housing because you are seriously ill, recovering from surgery or injury or high-risk pregnancy, or something of that nature, you may qualify for the [**Medically Fragile Homeless Program**](Directory.md#Medically-Fragile-Homeless-Program).
They will help you with immediate housing, supportive services and coordinated case management to ensure physical recovery, access to income sources, connection to services, and a more permanent housing alternative when you exit the program.

### <a id="transitional-and-long-term-housing">Transitional and Long-Term Housing</a>

This section discusses more long-term housing options including *transitional housing* (a temporary home while you search for more long-term housing) and *affordable housing* or *subsidized housing* (a long-term home).

The [**Coordinated Entry System (CES)**](Directory.md#CES) is SLO county’s system for matching people in need with transitional or long-term housing that is appropriate for them.
If you want to get such housing, you should try to enter this system.
This can be more effective than trying to contact the many individual transitional or long-term housing programs one at a time.
To enter this system, contact one of the many participating agencies, such as [**SLO County Department of Social Services**](Directory.md#SLO-County-Department-of-Social-Services), [**5Cities Homeless Coalition**](Directory.md#5CHC), [**Community Action Partnership San Luis Obispo (CAPSLO)**](Directory.md#CAPSLO), [**Transitions Mental Health Association**](Directory.md#TMHA), [**Good Samaritan Shelter**](Directory.md#Good-Samaritan-Shelter), or [**SLO County Health Department**](Directory.md#SLO-County-Health-Department).

A program called [**Housing Now**](Directory.md#Housing-Now) finds homes for the most vulnerable chronically homeless people from SLO County.
You cannot apply directly to participate in this program, but if you enter the Coordinated Entry System (see above), that system may eventually place you in this program so that you can quickly get a home.

The [**Behavioral Health Bridge Housing (BHBH)**](Directory.md#BHBH) has some quality, affordable short-term (less than 90 days) and medium term (90 days to two years) housing for people in SLO county who have severe behavioral health issues who are homeless or at risk of homelessness.

[**5Cities Homeless Coalition (5CHC)**](Directory.md#5CHC) operates a [housing assistance program](https://5chc.org/programs/housing-assistance) that offers case management and financial assistance for rent, deposit, and immediate needs, and housing assistance through various funding grants.
This is available both to currently homeless people and to people in danger of becoming homeless.
Contact 5CHC to arrange a confidential coordinated entry interview.

[**El Camino Homeless Organization (ECHO)**](Directory.md#ECHO) operates transitional (90-day) shelters in Atascadero and Paso Robles that serve people experiencing homelessness.
People who live in these shelters also get individualized case management services to help them find employment and long-term housing.

They will not admit P.C. 290 registered sex offenders.

The [**CalWORKS Homeless Assistance Program**](Directory.md#CalWORKS) can pay a one-time security deposit and/or last month’s rent and/or utility deposit for families who are homeless or who have received a “Pay Rent or Quit” notice on their current rental home.

The cabins come with 24/7 support, case management, connections to food services and recovery, and house stabilization guidance.
They have on-site laundry and showers.
They accept pets.
They typically have a long waiting list.
Apply through [**5Cities Homeless Coalition**](Directory.md#5CHC) to get on the waiting list.

[**Housing Authority of SLO (HASLO)**](Directory.md#HASLO) operates several affordable housing properties in SLO county.
Typically in these projects, residents pay a portion of the rent, while the rest of the rent is paid for them by subsidies or vouchers.
To qualify to rent one of these housing units, you must have enough income to pay your portion of the rent, but you must not have so much income that you could afford non-subsidized housing.
Typically this means households that earn less than 30% of the area median income.
Preference is given to SLO County residents and to veterans. Some housing is restricted to seniors (age 62 and above).
You need to provide proof of income and your prior rental history.
Most of these housing units have wait lists, and only some of them accept new applications at any time.

[**Paso Robles Housing Authority**](Directory.md#Paso-Robles-Housing-Authority) operates several affordable housing properties in Paso Robles designed for people who have around 30–60% of the area median income.
You can fill out an application on their website. If your application is accepted, you will be put on the waiting list.
You must include copies of the latest three months’ paycheck stubs, proof of other sources of income, and a copy of your last two years’ federal income tax returns.
You may be rejected if you have recently been evicted, have defaulted on debts, or have certain criminal convictions.

[**Lumina Alliance**](Directory.md#Lumina-Alliance) operates a six- to 24-month [transitional housing program](https://luminaalliance.org/transitional-housing/) for individuals and families who are fleeing domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and/or stalking.
People housed through this program also get access to advocacy services, employment assistance, counseling, legal help, children’s services, life skills development, and help obtaining permanent housing.
If you are homeless or in need of housing due to fleeing abusive situation, have low or very low income, and are willing to participate in Lumina’s program and to cooperate with them in following a safety plan, you may qualify for transitional housing through this program.

Adults in SLO County who live with mental illness may qualify for supportive housing in multiple county locations through the [**Transitions Mental Health Association (TMHA)**](Directory.md#TMHA) [residential housing program](https://www.t-mha.org/program-details.php?id=6).

The [**HomeShare SLO**](Directory.md#HomeShare-SLO) program matches property owners who have an extra room with people who need a place to live.
They have a “reduced rent task exchange” program with which you can do 8–15 hours of work per week to get a rent reduction.

[**Restorative Partners**](Directory.md#Restorative-Partners) runs a [housing program](https://restorativepartners.org/housing/) with multiple transitional housing programs for men, women, and families in various SLO County locations.
These programs are for people in recovery from addiction and people transitioning from incarceration.
Some are specific to women with children.
Along with housing, residents get help with employment support, financial literacy, life skills, addiction recovery, and help finding permanent housing.
There is a wait list.

[**Salvation Army**](Directory.md#Salvation-Army) has a “Rapid Rehousing Program” that helps people find and qualify for long-term housing.

The [**HouseKeys**](Directory.md#HouseKeys) program is the city of SLO’s affordable home-ownership program.
It serves households who bring in about 30–50% of the area median income.
Their idea of “affordable” may not be yours.
If you want to apply for housing through this program, begin the [application process](https://www.housekeys.org/applicationprocess) described on their website.

[**Habitat for Humanity SLO County**](Directory.md#Habitat-for-Humanity) operates a home ownership program for first-time low-income home buyers and home preservation assistance (minor repairs, landscaping, painting) for low-income homeowners.
Apply via their website.

They also operate affordable rental housing developments and supportive housing programs.
They serve low-income families, farmworkers, seniors, veterans, people with disabilities, and formerly-homeless people.
Contact them directly to access the program.

## <a id="property-storage-options">**Property storage options**</a>

### Short-Term

If you need to securely store a small amount of property for a few hours or overnight, you have a few options:

The [**40 Prado Homeless Services Center**](Directory.md#40-Prado) has storage lockers available for people who have completed intake for day services there.
<!-- To-do: need more details about who can use these lockers, under what conditions, and what size the lockers are; do they also offer document storage? -->

The commercial service [Bounce](https://bounce.com/) partners with multiple locations (in SLO County, these are typically UPS Stores) to offer short-term luggage storage that typically runs about $7 per day or $20–80 per month (depending on weight and size).
You can find the specific locations, terms and conditions, and costs at their website.

In a few locations in SLO County (Morro St. in SLO, at Cal Poly, and at the Curbaril Park-n-Ride in Atascadero) you can find [on-demand bike lockers](https://rideshare.org/bike-lockers/).
These cost 5¢ per hour and can be rented for up to seven consecutive days.
Use the [BikeLink](https://www.bikelink.org/) app to access and pay for these lockers.
They are for bicycles only (you cannot use them to store other personal belongings like carts or suitcases), but you can probably get away with storing pannier bags along with your bicycle.

### Long-Term

There are several commercial long-term storage options in SLO County.
You can find these by doing a web search for terms like “self storage” or “mini storage”.
They typically rent spaces by the month, and have different-sized units available at different prices.
5′×5′, 5′×10′, and 10′×10′ units are typical.
You can expect to pay about $60–75 per month for the least-expensive and smallest sizes, up to $150 for larger sizes.
Most storage facilities have daytime hours of operation when you can access the storage units to add or remove property, and are closed to everyone at night.

The California Department of Education has a “Summer Food Service Program” to help children during the Summer school break who usually get meals at school.
This program is open to all children in the community.
You can find a list of [Summer Meal Sites in San Luis Obispo County](https://www.cde.ca.gov/ds/sh/sn/ap/summersites.asp?year=2025&countyname=San_Luis_Obispo) at the California Department of Education website.

### Senior Meal Programs

[**Meals that Connect**](Directory.md#Meals-that-Connect) has several sites in SLO County where they serve communal lunches every weeekday.
The program is for people aged 60 and above.
You must fill out an application to join the program, and you must reserve your meals two days in advance.
They also can deliver meals to your home if you are homebound.

[**Five Cities Meals on Wheels**](Directory.md#5Cities-Meals-on-Wheels) is a similar program specific to the Five Cities area that provides daily meals, delivered to the homes of people who cannot prepare nutritious meals for themselves and do not have caretakers who can do so.
They serve seniors and people with temporary or permanent disabilities.

Low-income seniors (aged 60 and above) can get $20–50 in credit to use at participating farmers markets from the California Department of Food and Agriculture.
There is limited availability, so if the program runs out of credits you may have to wait until their next budget to apply.
Learn more about the program and apply to join it at [their website](https://www.cdfa.ca.gov/SeniorFarmersMrktNutritionPrgm/).

### CalFresh / EBT (Food Stamps) and WIC

The CalFresh program is California’s version of the federal nutrition program known as “SNAP” or “food stamps.”
If you have a low income, California will give you an “EBT card” which you can use like a debit card at grocery stores and farmers markets to buy healthy foods.

You can apply for CalFresh on-line at either of the following sites:

- [BenefitsCal.com](https://benefitscal.com/)
- [GetCalFresh.org](https://www.getcalfresh.org/)

You can also apply in person at the [**SLO County Department of Social Services**](Directory.md#SLO-County-Department-of-Social-Services).

If you are a Cal Poly student, you can get assistance from the [**Cal Poly CalFresh Program**](https://www.calfreshcalpoly.org/).

You will need some identification document, proof of income, and (for students) indication of student status, and (for non-citizens) immigration status.
Suitable proof of income includes pay stubs from last 30 days, an employer letter on company letterhead, tax forms (1040, W-2, 1099), self-employment profit/loss statement or ledger, or a signed written statement if you do not have those documents.
See [calfresh.guide](https://calfresh.guide/verifications-the-calfresh-office-requires/) for more details.

Some local farmers markets will double up to $15 in CalFresh benefits that you spend at the market, so you can get twice as much food for your money.
See [slocountyfarmers.org](https://www.slocountyfarmers.org/snap) for details.

The [**Women, Infants, and Children (WIC)**](Directory.md#WIC) program also provides E-WIC debit cards with which you can buy certain types of food from farmers markets and WIC-approved groceries.

### <a id="transportation-to-medical-appointments">Transportation to Medical Appointments</a>

The [CenCal/Medi-Cal Shuttle](https://www.cencalhealth.org/members/transportation/) offers free, door-to-door transportation to medical appointments for people who are enrolled in Medi-Cal and who can­not use public transportation to get to their appointments.
If you expect you will need to stop at a pharmacy after your appointment, say so when you make your shuttle reservation.
Make a shuttle reservation at least three days before your medical appointment by calling 855-659-4600.

If you are a [**Community Health Centers of the Central Coast (CHC)**](Directory.md#CHC) patient, and you need a ride to your CHC appointment, you can get shuttle service.
The CHC Shuttle picks you up at your location and drops you off at the clinic, then returns you after your appointment.
To use the shuttle, you should have a CHC appointment and live in the area of the CHC clinic.
CHC may also give you an RTA bus pass to help you get to your appointment.
Make a reservation at least 48 hours before your appointment by calling 877-743-3242.
They will call you back within 24 hours to confirm your reservation.

Veterans who travel to VA health care facilities for VA-authorized appointments can get free curb-to-curb shuttle service through [**Veterans Transportation Service (VTS)**](Directory.md#Veterans-Transportation-Service).
Another option is the “Veterans Express Shuttle” operated by [**Ride-On Transportation**](Directory.md#Ride-On-Transportation) (call 805-541-8747 two to three days before your appointment).
There is also regularly-scheduled bus service between the SLO Veteran’s Memorial Building (801 Grand Ave.) and the West Los Angeles VA Medical Center (WLA).

Schedule a bus reservation through VTS.
It leaves SLO at 6am, arrives at WLA at 11:15am, leaves WLA at 3:25pm and returns to SLO at 8:30pm.

They also sell refurbished bicycles at low prices.
Visit their website to see their current schedule.
They charge a small fee ($5) to use their repair/maintenance services.

Here are some tips for keeping your bike safe if you are camping:

- Lock bikes together when you camp with multiple people.
- Position your bike near your tent and thread one of the tent’s guy-lines through the wheel, so your tent will shake if someone moves the bike.
- Use multiple locks (for example, a U-lock and a cable). Avoid using cable locks only, as they are relatively easy to break.
- Consider using a lock that makes an audible alarm when it is tampered with.

## <a id="tattoo-removal">**Tattoo removal**</a>

There are programs available that will erase your tattoos.
This can help you if you have tattoos that interfere with your ability to get a job or that are suggestive of gang or hate group affiliation.
Tattoo removal can help you get a fresh start, unburdened by regretful decisions from your past.

The process of laser tattoo removal takes time.
Typically you undergo between five and twelve visits, each one lasting about five minutes, over several months.
In each visit a laser breaks down ink particles in your tattoo so that your immune system can remove them.
The tattooed area will become red and swollen soon after treatment, but this eventually settles down.
Sometimes there is some blistering and scabbing.
You will need to take some care to keep the area of the tattoo clean, and to apply some ointments that assist healing.

The [**Liberty Tattoo Removal Program**](Directory.md#Liberty-Tattoo-Removal-Program) offers laser tattoo removal of gang-related, anti-social, or economically limiting tattoos.
You are required to do four hours of community service (or an equivalent financial donation) before each treatment, but there is otherwise no cost.
You must agree to remain clean and sober, and to get no more tattoos, during the treatment.
This service is offered locally, in SLO County.

[**Catholic Charities**](Directory.md#CatholicCharities) has a low-cost tattoo removal program ($20–90 per session, on a sliding scale based on ability to pay).
You must also complete 20 hours of community service before beginning treatment.
They prioritize the removal of offensive or gang-related tattoos, and will remove both visible-and-obvious tattoos (e.g. the face, the back of the hands) and more discreet ones.
Call them to begin the process.

The [Removery INK-nitiative Program](https://removery.com/services/ink-nitiative) offers free removal of tattoos, if those tattoos are in visible areas (face, hands, arms) or suggest gang or hate group affiliation, to people who have ben incarcerated, are former gang members, or are survivors of domestic abuse or human trafficking.
Apply on their website.

The [Jails to Jobs](https://jailstojobs.org/resources/tattoo-removal-programs) website lists hundreds of other free or low-cost tattoo removal programs throughout the country.

### Advance Directives and Legal Planning

1. **What Are Advance Directives?**
   - Definition: Legal documents that let you communicate your healthcare wishes in advance, in case you become unable to speak for yourself
   - Purpose: Ensure your medical care preferences are known and followed when you cannot communicate them
   - Types of advance directives:
      - Living Will: Written document specifying what medical treatments you would or would not want if terminally ill or in persistent vegetative state
      - Healthcare Power of Attorney: Designates a trusted person to make medical decisions for you when you cannot
      - Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) Orders: Written document expressing desire to refuse resuscitation efforts
   - Why they're important:
      - Control: Keeps healthcare decisions in the hands of people you trust
      - Clarity: Family members guess end-of-life preferences incorrectly about one-third of the time
      - Reduces burden: Helps loved ones make difficult decisions and may reduce their guilt and depression
      - Peace of mind: Provides assurance that your wishes will be respected
   - When to create them: The best time is *before* you need them, while you can still make clear decisions

1. **Personal Safety Tips for Homeless and Vulnerable Individuals**
   1. **Situational Awareness**
      - **Stay alert**: Don't be distracted by phone or headphones when walking alone
      - **Trust your instincts**: If a situation feels unsafe, remove yourself immediately
      - **Walk with confidence**: Chin up, eyes forward, steady pace
      - **Develop street smarts**: Learn to differentiate trustworthy from untrustworthy people
         - **Be cautious with new relationships**: Be guarded and hesitant to develop relationships until you can identify reliable people—many have been victimized by those claiming to help
         - **Trust your instincts**: If someone feels unsafe or pushes too hard for your trust, avoid them
         - **Build peer networks**: Connect with similarly situated people who understand your situation
         - **Watch for red flags**: Avoid people who try to exploit vulnerabilities, offer "too good to be true" deals, or pressure you into uncomfortable situations
         - Note: Developing these skills takes time and street experience—don't expect to master this immediately
      - Source: [instructables.com](https://www.instructables.com/Basic-Street-Safety-for-Women/)

      - **Stay vigilant**: Maintain awareness even in supposedly safe environments
      - Source: [Bautista Project shelter safety guide](https://www.thebautistaprojectinc.org/post/personal-security-homeless-shelter)

      - **Prevention focus**: Avoid physical incidents through awareness and de-escalation
      - **Simple techniques**: Learn basic moves to make an attacker reconsider and give you time to escape

## <a id="mail-drops-post-office-boxes-etc">**Mail drops, post office boxes, etc.**</a>

If you are homeless, you may be at a loss when asked for your mailing address.
There are various ways to establish a reliable mailing address even if you do not have a stable living address.

The [**5Cities Homeless Coalition**](Directory.md#5CHC) and [**40 Prado Homeless Services Center**](Directory.md#40-Prado) offices permit clients of their services to use these offices as mailing addresses, and will hold your incoming mail there for you.
Ask them for details.

You can rent mail boxes from UPS Stores and from the U.S. Postal Service.
The Postal Service option is the most affordable of the two.
But sometimes, a “P.O. Box” address (which is what you get from the Postal Service) is not adequate for your needs, and one advantage of the UPS Store option is that it appears as a regular street address (e.g. “1241 Johnson Avenue, San Luis Obispo”).

Another option is to ask people to send you mail addressed to [“General Delivery”](https://faq.usps.com/s/article/What-is-General-Delivery):
> *Your Name*<br />
> General Delivery<br />
> *City Name*, CA *ZIP-Code*‒9999

Here are some General Delivery zip codes for our area:

| Post Office     | ZIP Code   |
| --------------- | ---------- |
| Arroyo Grande   | 93420‒9999 |
| Atascadero      | 93422‒9999 |
| Grover Beach    | 93433‒9999 |
| Los Osos        | 93402‒9999 |
| Morro Bay       | 93442‒9999 |
| Nipomo          | 93444‒9999 |
| Oceano          | 93445‒9999 |
| Paso Robles     | 93446‒9999 |
| Pismo Beach     | 93449‒9999 |
| Santa Margarita | 93453‒9999 |
| Templeton       | 93465‒9999 |

You should speak with the postmaster at the post office where you want to receive general delivery mail beforehand.
The post office will hold general delivery mail for you for 30 days.
You must have a valid photo ID to pick up your mail at the post office.
This service is free.
However, this is not a long-term solution; it is meant for temporary use (for instance by travellers passing through town).
The post office may stop accepting general delivery mail for you if you try to use this method for a long time or if you get too much mail.

1. **Gig Economy**
   1. "Beer Money Sites" / "Get Paid to…" on-line gigs
      - Reddit has an ostensibly curated list of beermoney opportunities [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/ab0dyv/most_common_beer_money_sites_do_not_create/) and a community to discuss options at [r/beermoney](https://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/)
      - What beermoney programs are: Online platforms that pay small amounts of money for simple tasks like taking surveys, watching videos, testing apps, or completing offers. The term "beermoney" comes from earning enough for small extras like buying a beer, not full-time income.
      - How they work: Sign up for websites or apps, complete tasks during your free time, and get paid small amounts (usually $20–200 per month with consistent effort). Popular platforms recommended by Reddit users include Prolific, Freecash, and Cointiply.
      - Important caveats: These are not get-rich-quick schemes. Success requires treating it like part-time work with 30–90 minutes daily commitment. Focus on mastering 2–3 platforms rather than spreading yourself thin. Peak earning times are typically 6–10am and 7–11pm EST when new tasks appear.
      - How this helps people facing homelessness: Can provide small but steady income without needing a fixed address, formal employment, or special skills. Requires internet access and a device (smartphone, tablet, or computer). Good for people who have irregular schedules or cannot commit to traditional work hours.
      - Getting started: Need reliable internet access, email address, and valid ID for most platforms. Start with highly-rated sites from the Reddit community rather than random online ads.

## <a id="miscellaneous-tips">**Miscellaneous tips**</a>

1. Get assistance at the library:
   - Drop in, or make an appointment by calling/texting 805-540-0057

1. **Weather Patterns and Safety Planning for Unsheltered Individuals**
   - **Dangerous Cold Conditions**: December–February; overnight temperatures can fall below 40°F (warming centers open at 38°F or below)
   - **Dangerous Heat Conditions**: July–August remain the primary extreme heat period; daytime temperatures reach 80–89°F with occasional extremes above 90°F requiring heat emergency response. September can also experience high temperatures (average 77–82°F) with potential extremes—September 2020 saw record temperatures of 113–117°F. October temperatures typically moderate (average highs 74–77°F) but can still reach concerning levels for unsheltered individuals.
      - Historical Context: Temperature extremes above 90°F are relatively rare but do occur, most notably during September heat events. Normal yearly temperature range is 41-78°F.
      - 40 Prado cooling center opens between 8am & 6pm; they have a kennel for pets (all animals must have proof of rabies vaccination)
   - **Rainy Season**: December–February with January having highest precipitation (4+ inches); warming centers open with 50%+ chance of overnight rain
   - **Emergency Shelter Activation**: County warming/cooling centers open when temperatures ≤38°F *or* ≥50% chance of rain *or* dangerous heat conditions per National Weather Service
   - **Regional Considerations**: South County, Atascadero, Morro Bay, and Paso Robles identified as areas with high unsheltered populations needing weather protection
   - **Planning Advice**: Save resources for December–February cold/wet season and July–August extreme heat periods; contact 40 Prado at 805-544-4004 for warming center status (Note: Unable to verify 805-781-3660 in available sources; use main 40 Prado number)
