1. <a id="introduction">**Introduction**</a>
   1. Being homeless in SLO; why it’s so challenging to get a place
      - Sources and additional details for homelessness statistics: [wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness_in_California), [sanluisobispo.com](https://www.sanluisobispo.com/news/local/article311793858.html), [slocounty.ca.gov](https://www.slocounty.ca.gov/departments/social-services/homeless-services-division) for local statistics and context
      1. homelessness is especially widespread in California
         - there are many reasons for this, but the most important ones can be summed up by "too few houses for the number of people"
         - the reasons why *that* is a problem are complicated; many are policy decisions that prioritize other things over affordable housing, others have to do with resource scarcity
         - policymakers are flailing and are more interested in making non-homeless stakeholders happy than in helping homeless people, so don't expect much help from them
      1. housing is crazy-expensive and in short supply
         - there's a statewide housing shortage
         - housing is particularly expensive in the SLO area
         - SLO & Santa Maria are in the top ten cities in the U.S. for how much income (relative to the median income) you must have to afford to buy a home
         - In SLO County, a single adult living alone needs to earn at least $55,234 a year in order to cover the cost of basic living expenses. [Source: [sanluisobispo.com](https://www.sanluisobispo.com/news/local/article311793858.html)]
         - 10% of schoolchildren in SLO County are homeless, more than 3,000 children. [sanluisobispo.com](https://www.sanluisobispo.com/news/local/education/article311681975.html)
      1. more homeless people in SLO are unsheltered than in most places
         - there are enough shelter beds for about 20–30% of those who are known to be homeless in SLO County
         - SLO "county has the third highest percentage of unsheltered homelessness in the United States"
      - See [en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness_in_California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness_in_California) for some of these stats
   1. But there’s lots of help available (from individuals, informal organizations, nonprofits, government contractors, government agencies) — though it can be hard to get a good view of the helping landscape (this guide helps)
   1. How to use this guide
   1. What regions this guide covers / doesn’t cover
      - Covers SLO & Five-Cities area (Pismo Beach, Arroyo Grande, Oceano, Grover Beach, and Shell Beach)
      - Note: if the county or county agencies decide to sponsor this guide, we might expand coverage to the whole county
   1. How to make suggestions or corrections for future editions
   1. How your agency can order bulk copies
   1. Where to find a PDF on-line
   1. Special thanks to Laurel Woodson & Mark Grayson for initial funding

1. <a id="tips-on-self-advocacy-and-for-communicating-with-service-providers">**Tips on self-advocacy and for communicating with service providers**</a>
   1. **Building Effective Relationships with Case Managers and Service Providers**
      - **Be prepared for appointments**
         - **Bring documentation**: ID, any paperwork related to your situation, and a list of questions or needs
         - **Be on time**: Arrive early when possible; call if you'll be late
         - **Keep records**: Maintain a simple notebook or phone notes of appointments, contacts, and commitments made
      - **Communication strategies**
         - **Be honest and direct**: Clearly explain your situation, needs, and any barriers you're facing
         - **Ask questions**: Don't hesitate to ask for clarification about programs, requirements, or next steps
         - **Express appreciation**: Acknowledge when providers are helpful—positive relationships benefit everyone
         - **Follow up**: Check back on promised actions or referrals if you don't hear back within reasonable time
   1. **Self-Advocacy Fundamentals**
      - **Know your rights**
         - **Fair treatment**: Many service providers have non-discrimination policies and strive for respectful treatment, though policies vary between agencies; some services may have specific eligibility restrictions (veterans-only, income limits, etc.)
         - **Privacy**: Privacy policies vary by agency; government agencies often share information through HMIS (Homeless Management Information System); you'll receive privacy notices before data entry and can ask to review them later; some data may be required for services while other information can be withheld—ask about Release of Information (ROI) forms and their implications before signing
         - **Appeal processes**: Many programs have procedures for appealing decisions or filing complaints—ask program staff or search online to find the specific process; legal aid organizations can help with appeals (see [Legal assistance](#legal-assistance) section)
      - **Document everything**
         - **Keep copies**: Keep copies of important documents and applications
         - **Protect against theft/loss**: Store documents in waterproof bags, use your backpack as a pillow when sleeping, keep most important items in body pockets (money in bra/tight coin pocket), consider safety deposit box if you have income
         - **Take photos**: Use your phone to photograph important paperwork; enable automatic cloud backup (iCloud for iPhone, Google Photos for Android) so photos survive if phone is lost/stolen
         - **Cloud storage notes**: iPhones come with 5GB free iCloud storage, Android phones get 15GB free Google storage; turn on automatic backup in Settings to protect document photos
         - **Record interactions**: Note dates, names, and outcomes of important conversations
         - **Reference numbers**: Keep case numbers, application numbers, and confirmation numbers
   1. **Strengths-Based Self-Advocacy**
      - **Focus on your goals**: Clearly communicate what you're working toward (housing, employment, healthcare, etc.)
      - **Highlight relevant assets**: Share skills, experience, education, and personal strengths when relevant to services sought (e.g., work experience for employment services, but not necessarily for basic needs like clothing or food)
      - **Be imaginative and solution-oriented**: Come to meetings with ideas about what might work for your situation
      - **Take initiative**: Follow through on commitments and take active steps toward your goals
   1. **Navigating System Barriers**
      - **Understand program requirements**: Learn eligibility criteria, deadlines, and required steps for programs
      - **Ask about alternatives**: If you don't qualify for one program, ask about other options
      - **Request accommodations**: If you have disabilities or special needs, ask about available accommodations
      - **Escalate when necessary**: If you're not getting help, ask to speak with supervisors, use formal complaint procedures and appeal processes, or find someone who knows the system well to help you navigate it more effectively (e.g. case manager, behavioral health navigator, legal aid, peer advocates)
   1. **Working with Multiple Service Providers**
      - **Coordinate communications**: Let each provider know about other services you're receiving when relevant (e.g., tell housing programs about your income sources, but casual services like showers don't need to know about each other)
      - **Avoid application duplication**: If an agency plans to apply for a service in your name, tell them if you've already applied independently to prevent duplicate applications; keep track of which applications you've made or have been made on your behalf to avoid wasting time re-doing what's already been done
      - **Share information strategically**: Share information that's directly relevant to the services you're seeking (e.g., income for benefits applications, medical history for healthcare) while keeping unrelated personal details private
      - **Keep a contact list**: Maintain current contact information for all your service providers; ask for direct phone numbers or business cards from people familiar with your case to avoid navigating phone trees
   1. **Motivational Interviewing and Goal Setting**
      - **Set SMART goals**: Make your goals Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound
      - **Break down big goals**: Divide major objectives (like housing) into smaller, manageable steps
      - **Celebrate progress**: Acknowledge your achievements, even small ones
      - **Adjust as needed**: Be flexible and willing to modify goals as circumstances change
   1. **When Things Go Wrong**
      - **Stay calm and professional**: Even when frustrated, maintain respectful communication—this approach typically gets better results and faster resolution than confrontational approaches, though this may feel counterintuitive if you've learned to be assertive to protect yourself
      - **Document problems**: Record details about issues, including dates, names, and specific problems
      - **Don't give up too soon**: Persistence often pays off in navigating complex systems
   1. **Resource Navigation Tips**
      - **Use 211**: Call 2-1-1 for comprehensive information about available services
      - **Network with peers**: Other people in similar situations often have valuable information and tips
      - **Stay informed**: Keep up with changes in programs, funding, and eligibility requirements; note that this guide reflects information available at publication time, which may change—always contact service providers directly to verify current information before traveling to locations
      - **Build relationships**: Maintain connections with especially helpful providers even when not actively using their services
   1. **Managing Appointments and Commitments**
      - **Use reminders**: Set phone alarms or ask for reminder calls when available
      - **Plan transportation**: Ensure you have reliable transportation to appointments (see [Transportation](#transportation) section)
      - **Prepare for wait times**: Bring something to do and expect some delays in busy service settings
      - **Reschedule when necessary**: Call ahead if you need to change appointments rather than simply not showing up

           - Position bike near tent and thread guy line through wheel
           - Make bike less appealing: remove expensive accessories, personalize with stickers

           - Avoid solely using cable locks (90% of stolen bikes use only cable locks)
           - Heavy-duty chains (square-link) are hardest to cut
           - Chain + padlock through frame and wheel, secured to any available anchor

      - **Number of sessions**: Most tattoos require 10–12 visits for complete removal; some need 5–8 sessions
      - **Session spacing**: Treatments must be 6–8 weeks apart to allow healing
      - **Immediate effects**: Skin turns white ("frosting") immediately after treatment; area becomes red and swollen
      - **Healing timeline**: Initial healing 4–8 weeks; complete healing process 6–8 weeks per session
   1. Aftercare and Healing
      - **First 24–48 hours**: Apply ice compress (max 3 minutes at a time) for first hour; keep area clean and dry for 3 days
      - **Daily care**: Clean twice daily with mild soap and water; apply hydrocortisone cream or antibiotic ointment
      - **Critical restrictions**: Do not pick at blisters or scabs; avoid sun exposure; no swimming or soaking
      - **Supporting healing**: Stay hydrated, avoid alcohol, don't smoke (smoking slows healing and requires more treatments)
      - **Expected side effects**: Blistering and scabbing within 12–24 hours lasting up to 2 weeks is normal
   1. Employment and Life Benefits

         - **Develop street smarts**: Learn to differentiate trustworthy from untrustworthy people

            - **Build peer networks**: Connect with similarly situated people who understand your situation
            - **Watch for red flags**: Avoid people who try to exploit vulnerabilities, offer "too good to be true" deals, or pressure you into uncomfortable situations
            - **Note**: Developing these skills takes time and street experience—don't expect to master this immediately

   1. **Gig Economy**
      1. "Beer Money Sites" / "Get Paid to…" on-line gigs
         - Reddit has an ostensibly curated list of beermoney opportunities [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/ab0dyv/most_common_beer_money_sites_do_not_create/) and a community to discuss options at [r/beermoney](https://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/)
         - **What beermoney programs are:** Online platforms that pay small amounts of money for simple tasks like taking surveys, watching videos, testing apps, or completing offers. The term "beermoney" comes from earning enough for small extras like buying a beer, not full-time income.
         - **How they work:** Sign up for websites or apps, complete tasks during your free time, and get paid small amounts (usually $20–200 per month with consistent effort). Popular platforms recommended by Reddit users include Prolific, Freecash, and Cointiply.
         - **Important caveats:** These are not get-rich-quick schemes. Success requires treating it like part-time work with 30–90 minutes daily commitment. Focus on mastering 2–3 platforms rather than spreading yourself thin. Peak earning times are typically 6–10am and 7–11pm EST when new tasks appear.
         - **How this helps people facing homelessness:** Can provide small but steady income without needing a fixed address, formal employment, or special skills. Requires internet access and a device (smartphone, tablet, or computer). Good for people who have irregular schedules or cannot commit to traditional work hours.
         - **Getting started:** Need reliable internet access, email address, and valid ID for most platforms. Start with highly-rated sites from the Reddit community rather than random online ads.

        - Soak fire thoroughly with water
        - Stir ashes and embers to expose unburned material
        - Soak again until no heat remains
        - Test with hand - if too hot to touch, it's too hot to leave
      - **Special considerations for homeless populations:**
        - Tent fires are severe and common in homeless communities
        - Never leave fires unattended
        - Keep children and pets 3+ feet away

   1. **Weather Patterns and Safety Planning for Unsheltered Individuals**
      - **Dangerous Cold Conditions**: December–February; overnight temperatures can fall below 40°F (warming centers open at 38°F or below)
      - **Dangerous Heat Conditions**: July–August remain the primary extreme heat period; daytime temperatures reach 80–89°F with occasional extremes above 90°F requiring heat emergency response. September can also experience high temperatures (average 77–82°F) with potential extremes—September 2020 saw record temperatures of 113–117°F. October temperatures typically moderate (average highs 74–77°F) but can still reach concerning levels for unsheltered individuals.
         - **Historical Context**: Temperature extremes above 90°F are relatively rare but do occur, most notably during September heat events. Normal yearly temperature range is 41-78°F.
         - 40 Prado cooling center opens between 8am & 6pm; they have a kennel for pets (all animals must have proof of rabies vaccination)
      - **Rainy Season**: December–February with January having highest precipitation (4+ inches); warming centers open with 50%+ chance of overnight rain
      - **Emergency Shelter Activation**: County warming/cooling centers open when temperatures ≤38°F *or* ≥50% chance of rain *or* dangerous heat conditions per National Weather Service
      - **Regional Considerations**: South County, Atascadero, Morro Bay, and Paso Robles identified as areas with high unsheltered populations needing weather protection
      - **Planning Advice**: Save resources for December–February cold/wet season and July–August extreme heat periods; contact 40 Prado at 805-544-4004 for warming center status (Note: Unable to verify 805-781-3660 in available sources; use main 40 Prado number)
